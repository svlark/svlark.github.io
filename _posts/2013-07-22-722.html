I finished unit 3 in the first aid class.&nbsp; I doubt we'll have AED  aboard, but it was interesting nonetheless.&nbsp; I was interested to learn that it is in fact safe  to use on pregnant women, on kids and babies, in snow or rain, and  with a patient lying on a conductive surface.&nbsp; Those are all things that  would certainly have given me pause if I didn't know better.
