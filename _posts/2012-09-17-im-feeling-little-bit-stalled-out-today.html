I'm feeling a little bit stalled out today. &nbsp;We had a couple sales fall through yesterday, so that's a bummer. &nbsp;We did read the next chapter after the Cabo San Lucas thing, but it didn't really have any technical content. &nbsp;It was mainly just an account of the Pardeys' encounter with Bernard Moitessier in Cabo a couple days after Joshua was destroyed on the beach. <br /><br />I did a lot of "research" today though. &nbsp;As in flipping through boat listings by the hundreds. &nbsp;It's really a bad habit. &nbsp;I think you can fantasize yourself right out of ever actually doing anything. &nbsp;On the other hand I did do it a little more sytematically this time than I have previously, actually making some notes and stuff, so maybe that's legitimate research. <br /><br />OK, we're going to crash and read the third chapter on Cabo San Lucas. &nbsp;This one promises to be more technical.
