A &amp; L have been catching up on sleep the last couple mornings and so we have been light on our morning subjects.<br /><br />A and I did do a lesson out of Unit 5 in her math book and work on some subtraction and addition facts this morning, and this evening Audrey read a chapter of Jack and Annie, I read to the girls from Norse myths, and we read some poems from the Kennedy book.
