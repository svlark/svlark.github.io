July 2019 - Maine

It was only one overnight from Onset, Massachusetts to Rockland, Maine. It barely felt like a passage at all. We had heard amazing things about Penobscot Bay, so we decided it is where we should start our cruise of the Vacation State. 

![first look at maine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/62433086-0946dc80-b701-11e9-81b6-536fc97cbccb.jpeg)
Our first look at Maine

We started out in Rockland, because of the free anchoring, but just a short hop up the bay is Camden, where they were celebrating 4th of July with fireworks over the  harbor.

Lorelei found the cutest book store and made herself completely at home.

Jacob found a nice place to work too.

Camden is the birthplace of Edna St. Vincent Millay, a poet that we all love. It turns out that the hill she was writing about in Afternoon on a Hill was the hill directly behind our boat!

There are so many places to explore, just in this bay alone. We are keeping a faster pace and spending weekends (when we donâ€™t need great cell & internet) to check out the more remote locations.

More Hurricane Island!

Our new friends invited us to a kid-boat weekend on their private island. Our friends' father built this house completely out of drift wood!

We had such an amazing time. The whole place felt really magical. 

![Northhaven](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/62433112-1794f880-b701-11e9-9d9f-c3acd0843c0c.jpeg)
Next stop was Northhaven.

It was a real artists' community.

Lorelei driving us around in the dinghy. It's completely legal to be chauffered around in our 'family car' by our eight-year-old. 

Even though school is out for summer for so many, we are attempting to stay on track. We find that sticking to a schedule makes our daily routine more fun. We school year round, but take breaks for sailing, and visiting when ever the situation presents itself. 

![Audrey with her pirate ship](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/62433121-1f549d00-b701-11e9-9f21-c6c8bcd07220.jpeg)
One of Audrey's latest projects, a diagram of a pirate ship. She also did a lot of research on Blackbeard and the Queen Anne's Revenge after we sailed by where it sank in North Carolina. 

Audrey was due for a braces adjustment, and both girls had been dying to take my aunt and uncle up on their offer for a visit to Colorado, so they took off as unaccompanied minors first to Colorado, then to Chicago.

While the girls were away, Jacob and I acted like it was our second honeymoon.

Hiking in Acadia National Park

![Jacob putting on real shoes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/62433151-4317e300-b701-11e9-83a8-1bb690e62c41.jpeg)
Jacob is a true warm water cruiser now. It takes some serious hiking conditions to make him put on real shoes. 

![Ladders up Canadian Cliffs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/62433153-46ab6a00-b701-11e9-8a06-9025460e4320.jpeg)
We did an amazing hike complete with ladders drilled into the sides of cliffs and stairs carved into rock. 

![Jacob and I at the top of Canadian Cliffs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/62433146-3c896b80-b701-11e9-960a-903ed61bcfad.jpeg)
Jacob and I had an amazing view from the top of the Canada Cliffs trail. 

![Jacob with the lobster float](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/62433125-24195100-b701-11e9-861a-f15ab5d1f652.jpeg)
Oops! We hit a lobster pot. It brought our 30,000 pound boat going over 7 knots to a complete stop. Jacob had to jump out and cut the line around or prop. It was so cold! We are seriously thinking of investing in a wet suit after this experience. 


My Dad brought the girls home to us, and we showed him around Mt. Desert Island and Acadia National Park for a couple of days. 

![Audrey and Gramps in the launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/62433159-4dd27800-b701-11e9-8e8d-82156a16dba5.jpeg)
Riding the launch in Northeast Harbor. A service that comes with renting a float...along with showers, and laundry. 

![Lark on the float](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/62667451-adc15c80-b955-11e9-8100-afd21f7a3c8b.jpeg)
Lark on her float. Now we can describe lark as the one with the blue sail covers and the ENORMOUS orange kayak. It was like Christmas in July.

Swimming in Echo Lake with Grampsy. The water temperature was slightly warmer here than in the ocean. 

Mt. Desert Island and Acadia National Park is a dream for cruisers. It has protected anchorages, lots to do and a free bus that will pick you up almost anywhere and take you where you want to go. Perfect for those of us that are carless!

It was a bit crowded at this beach.

This seems pretty typical here in New England. Bright and sunny one minute followed by the fog rolling in.
