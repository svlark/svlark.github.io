Over the weekend, we were eating dinner on the patio of a restaurant where there was a big lawn with lots of kids. &nbsp;I was watching how Audrey was handling herself with a boy who kept harassing her playmate, and who eventually ended up hitting Audrey hard on the butt. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Now, it goes without saying that he brings shame on his parents, but that's not the point of my anecdote.</div><div><br></div><div>It's this: Rather than hitting him back, which I frankly wanted to do myself, she called after him, as he courageously ran away after hitting her, that he was "hideous." &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It also goes without saying that she could have handled that a bit better, and we did have a talk afterward about how insulting people is not a good way to resolve differences, but really, I was mostly just bursting with pride that she pulled out "hideous" in the heat of battle. Thank you, Ogden Nash.</div><div><br></div><div>April got this wonderful book of poetry and Audrey's going to be in charge of making selections for us all to learn each week:</div><div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pYFBuSqIBcE/UgHh_i6GhPI/AAAAAAAAEj4/KiF-jsyCx5U/s640/blogger-image-654404388.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pYFBuSqIBcE/UgHh_i6GhPI/AAAAAAAAEj4/KiF-jsyCx5U/s640/blogger-image-654404388.jpg"></a></div></div>
