# Guatemala: The First Half

#### By Audrey 

### Arrival
After our voyage we finally arrived in Guatemala. The first thing we did was raise the flag. Right after that we went to customs and immigration and got checked into the country.   That was the beginning of our marvelous adventures in Guatemala. 

![Flag up](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/43361924-170f6ae8-929b-11e8-854e-28a308965668.jpg)
We put up the Guatemalan flag and the Q flag

We just put the anchor down in Livingston

We found a miniature fort

It started raining on the way up the river

### Tijax
Our marina was called Tijax (pronounced Tee-hosh).  It is a beautiful little place in the jungle.  Tijax has a pool, a nature hike, and a restaurant. We love the hike to the look-out tower, and across the hanging bridges, 30 feet in the air. So far, we have done it three times… and even brought our friends to see the hike.

It feels like you can see Honduras from here

We love the pool at Tijax

### Friends
In Guatemala there is a huge cruising community and a lot of kids. The main people we hang out with are the five kids on a big blue catamaran: Eli, Aaron, Sarah, Sam, and Rachel.  We met them in Florida when we bought our first boat Lark, and I was only 6. We haven’t seen them since we left Ft. Pierce for our first big cruise down to the Florida Keys. It was really nice to have old friends to play with again in Guatemala! We also played with the Norwegian kids on from a big white cat who have a girl called Sigrid (she’s my age), and two boys, Oscill and Villiard.  I’m excited to get back in October to play with everyone again.

### The Ukeladies                 
  Ms. Tanya, the mom on the big blue catamaran, is teaching us to play the ukulele. We are taking lessons 3 times a week and working on a few songs but the only one we played on open mic night was The Lion Sleeps Tonight. I really enjoy it, and I feel like I’m getting better fast! I even played an open mic night by myself once (my mom was too nervous to do a duet with me).

### The Boat Painting
Right now, our boat is being painted and we moved off and into a little cabin in the jungle. It has two bedrooms, a bathroom (that’s really easy to get locked inside), a kitchen and screen porch. It also has a pool and a sweet puppy (that unfortunately may have a skin disease)!
