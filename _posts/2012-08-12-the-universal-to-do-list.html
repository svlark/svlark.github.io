I was thinking about this today: &nbsp;I can actually very easily write a comprehensive to-do list for this effort, or for any effort, for that matter. &nbsp;Here it is:<br /><ol><li>Figure out what needs to be done.</li><li>Figure out how to do it.</li><li>Do it.</li></ol><div>I'm going to start right now!</div><div><br /></div><div>What needs to be done:</div><div><ol><li>Sail to an interesting place. &nbsp;Stay awhile. &nbsp;Repeat.</li><li>Teach our girls what they need to know to thrive on their own.</li></ol></div><div>Now we just need to figure out how to do these things. &nbsp;I don't know how, but I do know how to start figuring out how, since I have a universal todo list. &nbsp;So for each of these items, I will:&nbsp;Figure out what needs to be done, figure out how to do it, and do it. <br /><br /></div><div>So, first item -- "Sail to an interesting place. &nbsp;Stay awhile. &nbsp;Repeat." &nbsp;What needs to be done?</div><div><ol><li>Get a sea-worthy, livable boat.</li><li>Provision</li><li>Cast off.</li><li>Get to an interesting place.</li><li>Drop anchor.</li><li>Explore.</li><li>Repair, reprovision, repeat.</li></ol><div>OK, first item again -- "Get a sea-worthy, livable boat." &nbsp;How the heck do we do that? &nbsp;First thing -- figure out what needs to be done.</div><div><ol><li>Figure out what we need in a boat.</li><li>Figure out what that's going to cost.</li><li>Save or borrow and repay the money for the more affordable of these:</li><ul><li>the most affordable boat that meets all our needs, or&nbsp;</li><li>the most affordable combination of a boat that could meet our needs and the additional services and equipment to bring it into such condition that it does meet them.</li></ul><ol></ol><li>Buy the boat.</li><li>Buy the equipment and services needed&nbsp;to bring the boat into the desired condition.</li></ol><div>First item again -- "Figure out what we need in a boat." What needs to be done to accomplish this?</div></div><div><ol><li>Become knowledgeable about the various aspects of cruising boats.</li><li>Find out what other people with similar goals in similar circumstances have found important and unimportant and why.</li><li>Make decisions about what is important and unimportant to us.</li></ol></div><div><div>First item again -- "Become knowledgeable about cruising boats." What needs to be done to accomplish this? &nbsp;I'm going to start to do a couple levels at once, and&nbsp;we're starting to get to things we can actually get to step 3 on (do it) today. &nbsp;</div><div><ol><li>Find out what the best sources for information are on cruising boats by:</li><ol><li>doing internet research to find out the&nbsp;comprehensive and accurate&nbsp;books and websites</li><li>asking well-informed people what resources they find most comprehensive and accurate</li></ol><li>Get access to the information by:</li><ol><li>visiting and bookmarking websites</li><li>getting the books</li></ol><li>Internalize the information.</li><ol><li>Read.</li><li>Make notes.</li><li>Think about the information.</li></ol></ol></div><div>And now, our first second item -- "Find out what other people with similar goals in similar circumstances have found important and unimportant and why." &nbsp;</div><div><ol><li>Find out what the best sources are for information on the opinions of experienced cruising families are by:</li><ol><li>doing internet research to find out the&nbsp;comprehensive and accurate&nbsp;books and websites</li><li>asking well-informed people what resources they find most comprehensive and accurate</li></ol><li>Get access to the information by:</li><ol><li>visiting and bookmarking websites.</li><li>getting the books.</li></ol><li>Internalize the information.</li><ol><li>Read.</li><li>Make notes.</li><li>Think about the information.</li></ol></ol><div>OK, well, this could go on for awhile. &nbsp;In fact I'm sure it will take the next several years at least. &nbsp;This is the approach I'm going to try taking on the <a href="http://windwardreach.blogspot.com/p/to-do.html">To-do list</a>. &nbsp;We'll see how it goes...</div></div></div></div>
