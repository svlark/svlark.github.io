We went to the boat show.  As expected there wasn't a whole lot to see, but it was fun anyway. The only sail boat was a Precision 23, which was cute.  The most exciting thing to happen was undoubtedly when Audrey was picked from the crowd of something like 100 kids to hold Twiggy the water-skiing squirrel.<br /><br />We also got a call from another person interested in seeing the house, which provided the motivation for me to put on a  burst of housework in preparation. If nothing else we should have new, improved pictures to post soon.<br /><br /> <br/><br/><div class="separator"style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qJ8Drt9tkC4/UPLdHeBpFCI/AAAAAAAAaD0/WTNcsmxOYbA/s640/blogger-image-51438351.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qJ8Drt9tkC4/UPLdHeBpFCI/AAAAAAAAaD0/WTNcsmxOYbA/s640/blogger-image-51438351.jpg" /></a></div>
