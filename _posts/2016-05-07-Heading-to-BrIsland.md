We're going to Harbour Island tomorrow via the infamous Devil's Backbone.  We have a local pilot who will take us through the 6 miles from Spanish Wells to the eponymous harbor.  Pink sand beaches, here we come!  

In the meanwhile, I built a nice little sand castle with the Spanish Wells' amazing sand.
