In my first post, I said, "The journey is the destination..." but in a more recent post I complained that sometimes our goal seemed so far away that we might never get there. &nbsp;Silly me! &nbsp;I almost forgot that the journey is the destination. &nbsp;So let me tell you about my day at the destination.<br /><br />April's been craving a day free of child care and today was it. &nbsp;She headed out for the evening last night and spent the night in Blackhawk with some other mommies. &nbsp;She hung out with them most of the morning then rolled down to the flats for some errands until after bedtime today. <br /><br />Well, Sweet Pea, Audrey, Lorelei and I had a great 24 hours on our own. &nbsp;After Mom headed out last night the four of us settled in to watch <u>The Rescuers</u>. &nbsp;I had a 45 when I was a kid that had an abridged version of the audio from that movie, but I'd never seen it until yesterday. &nbsp;So of course it brought back some memories and I thought it was a really good movie. &nbsp;What great voicing. &nbsp;But the best part was that Audrey and Lorelei both decided to curl up on my lap so I got to spend the whole movie cuddling with my girls. &nbsp;It may never happen again that both of them are in the mood to be still &nbsp;and relax for 90 minutes, but it was really nice.<br /><br />We all slept in until 8 this morning. &nbsp;Yes, that's sleeping in. &nbsp;After breakfast we all played in the basement until almost lunch. &nbsp;Then we all took Sweet Pea for a walk and got good and cold, so we had hot chocolate for lunch. &nbsp;After nap, we built a pillow fort in the basement and read 8 books. &nbsp;That was so much fun that we decided to set up the tent in the basement and watch <u>The Rescuers</u> again. &nbsp;By the time that was done, Lorelei was asking to go to bed. &nbsp;After putting her down, Audrey and I turned out all the lights and did our <u>Teach Your Child To Read</u> exercises and read our Laura and Mary book by the flashlight. <br /><br />My computer battery is about to die, but tomorrow I'll give an update on the <u>Teach Your Child To Read</u> situation.
