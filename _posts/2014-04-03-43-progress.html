The Faulkners of Colorado have just <a href="http://hotspur41.blogspot.com/2014/04/bon-voyage.html">weighed anchor for Hiva Oa</a>.&nbsp; Awesome!&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to hearing about their adventures.<br /><br />More planning and mental organization on tap for tonight.&nbsp; Hey, if all we ever do is plan then we won't ever need to bother with actually dong anything!&nbsp; Kidding, kidding,<br /><br />
