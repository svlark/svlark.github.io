We got started on Lin and Larry's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Aiy97sjxZWcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cost+Conscious+Cruiser&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RLAkUqTOBanlyQH5u4HYBg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cost%20Conscious%20Cruiser&amp;f=false">Cost Conscious Cruiser</a>.<br /><br />We looked at some apartments and RV parks yesterday to try to get a handle on what we'll do next.<br /><br />I continued research on passports, and spent some time looking into marine diesel and electric training programs, both in the interest of our own maintenance and as a possible revenue stream for when we're out. <a href="http://www.occsailing.com/">The School of Sailing &amp; Seamanship</a> looks pretty good, as does the <a href="http://annapolisschoolofseamanship.com/index.html">Annapolis School of Seamanship</a>.<br /><br />I've also been looking into courses on USCG Captains' licensing programs, as the credential would certainly smooth the way for chartering and delivery income.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.marinerslearningsystem.com/home.php">Mariners Learning System</a> looks pretty cool...<br /><br /><br />
