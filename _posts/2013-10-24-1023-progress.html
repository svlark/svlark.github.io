Moving has rocked our worlds but we are starting to get back to our routines and back to feeling like ourselves.&nbsp; April and Audrey did school today, and the girls both did PE.&nbsp;<br /><br />We closed on the house yesterday, and with that we are debt free.&nbsp; Those are big steps.<br /><br />Here's a picture of Audrey and our moving truck.&nbsp; Cool, right?&nbsp; Though I wouldn't recommend U-haul to anyone ever after our experience.&nbsp; Remind me to tell you about that sometime.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FObKV4Xij9s/UmidR2XU8yI/AAAAAAAAEp8/aBJbGvAvZsg/s640/blogger-image-1787168114.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FObKV4Xij9s/UmidR2XU8yI/AAAAAAAAEp8/aBJbGvAvZsg/s640/blogger-image-1787168114.jpg" /></a></div>
