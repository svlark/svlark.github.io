Man I'm struggling to stay on the wagon. Must ... blog ....<br /><br />I've got my neighbor Nick the plumber coming tomorrow evening to take a look at these crazy shower fixtures we're trying to remove.  No screws, no holes, no nothing.  <br /><br />I'm also going to try to talk him into renting his truck a few weeks from now do I can haul away demo refuse from all these projects.  <br /><br />Len's got a bunch of new stuff varnished up beautifully and ready to install: window sill for the kitchen; mud room bench seat and shelves; bi-fold door for upstairs bathroom; assorted other pieces.<br /><br />235.4
