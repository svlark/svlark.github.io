I tested out that new paint in a couple spots and it's a perfect match in color and sheen.  So maybe we can get away with some spot jobs rather than having to do any big expensive paint jobs.<br /><br />I was doing some research on good boating books for the kids and came up with some candidates:<br /><br />The Craft of Sail: A Primer of Sailing<br />Swallows and Amazons <br />Sarah's Boat: A Young Girl Learns the Art of Sailing<br />Sail Away<br />Kids for Sail<br />Time of Wonder<br /><br />Time for a nice chapter of South from Alaska...<br /><br />-30.3 @ 240.9<br />
