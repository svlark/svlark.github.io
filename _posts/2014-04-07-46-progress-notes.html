We had a really productive weekend.&nbsp; We sold the girls' dressers; got our bedroom furniture moved down to the garage all ready to be sold; I picked up a bunch of clear plastic bins to be our 15 boxes; I got one of our 15 boxes packed; we got the girls' toys down to 5 stuffies and 1 box of toys each, and April finished going through all the old printed photos.
