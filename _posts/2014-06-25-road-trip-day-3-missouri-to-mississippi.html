We left Bolivar Missouri at 10:30 this morning. A little better then the last 2 days, but still not the early start we have hoped for. The girls have not been napping in the car at all and getting to bed late every night, so it is really hard to wake them when they look so cozy.<br /><br />We saw two horse drawn carriages on the highway today near Mansfield. It looked like they were being driven by amish men. They crossed right in front of a truck going at least 50 mph. It was all very exciting!<br /><br />The girls were starting to go nuts in the backseat right before we pulled into Rocky Ridge Farm. Perfect timing for them to run around Laura and Almanzo's farm a bit. The stop was all we had hoped for. It was really cool to see all of the details from the Rose books in real life. Laura's wood burning stove was way bigger then I had imagined it. We learned that Laura was only 4'11", her clothes looked like they were little girl sized.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-10pBdVAV9vw/U6mqS9S4wbI/AAAAAAAAb0w/K1_7k8O5sp0/s1600/DSC04145.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-10pBdVAV9vw/U6mqS9S4wbI/AAAAAAAAb0w/K1_7k8O5sp0/s1600/DSC04145.jpg" height="398" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">In front of Laura and Almanzo's house</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xMGdjIVhCmc/U6mqTwSfGbI/AAAAAAAAb00/SBNEyreCTFw/s1600/DSC04148.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xMGdjIVhCmc/U6mqTwSfGbI/AAAAAAAAb00/SBNEyreCTFw/s1600/DSC04148.jpg" height="392" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">part of Rocky Ridge Farm</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7k_967VHOyo/U6mqU0Vlq1I/AAAAAAAAb08/Ppl3bPYdztc/s1600/DSC04150.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7k_967VHOyo/U6mqU0Vlq1I/AAAAAAAAb08/Ppl3bPYdztc/s1600/DSC04150.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The little section was the original house before they built onto it..&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dn_ldLY6MdY/U6mqXlWXbyI/AAAAAAAAb1I/ttc9sJlkZIA/s1600/DSC04155.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dn_ldLY6MdY/U6mqXlWXbyI/AAAAAAAAb1I/ttc9sJlkZIA/s1600/DSC04155.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>We stopped for Jonesboro's best BBQ for dinner.
