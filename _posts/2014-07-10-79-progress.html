Oh man, I almost forgot that we have a blog.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lark got her bottom painted today with some sweet $250/gallon Trinidad.&nbsp; Looks good. Watch for pics.&nbsp;<br /><br />We still need to switch decals and update her FL registration in order to launch.<br /><br />It's been tricky getting used to working from 10 until 7 and I've been having to stay light on my toes with the internet access.&nbsp; I blew through 10G on my 5G/mo Mifi in the past two days (which was already at 7G for the mo).&nbsp; This afternoon I discovered that I can get great connectivity to an Xfinity Wifi hotspot, but only sitting on the bathroom floor.&nbsp; Who says telecommuting isn't awesome?<br /><br />I did find an awesome tool called <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html">Little Snitch</a> which helps you understand and manage which applications are generating network traffic<br /><br />Well, we'll work out the kinks and get into a routine here shortly.&nbsp; I think.
