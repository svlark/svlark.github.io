I stuck a garden hose in the bilge and opened up the spigot on the pier and learned that our high capacity bilge pump works great! &nbsp;Only the hose doesn't actually go out of he boat. &nbsp;And then a little shoelace down in the bilge got caught in the pump and the pump quit. &nbsp;Not so good... &nbsp;But excellent to discover this here at the marina rather than 10 miles offshore. &nbsp;Or 30, someday. &nbsp;Hooray for trying crazy things, like running a garden hose into the bilge!
