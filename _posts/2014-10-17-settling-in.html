It's already starting to feel normal. &nbsp;It's funny how completely different it is to be aboard Lark when she's home than when &nbsp;being aboard meant being away from home.<br><div><div><br></div><div>We have lots of moving in left to do and a project list that continues to grow, but we are here and it feels more comfortable by the hour.</div><div><br></div><div>I actually have a better internet situation now than I have since we left Colorado. While the official wifi service in the marina is laughably bad, I've plugged my own base station in to an ethernet cable in the boaters' lounge and am getting a strong signal and a fast connection from there.</div><div><br></div><div>The bunk in our aft cabin is roomier and more comfortable than we'd hoped and we're thrilled with that. &nbsp;The girls are mostly sleeping through the night and mostly getting along in the v-berth.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ETkLQ_Squ4U/VEMNa_Qii6I/AAAAAAAAc-8/dg_SZ6NUCsw/s640/blogger-image--2023510971.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ETkLQ_Squ4U/VEMNa_Qii6I/AAAAAAAAc-8/dg_SZ6NUCsw/s640/blogger-image--2023510971.jpg"></a></div>
