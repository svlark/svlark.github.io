April's getting the photos ready to ship out for scanning (probably at <a href="http://mikescamera.com/print-scanning.html">Mike's</a>).&nbsp; I went through our old files and have a very small file of stuff to keep; a larger one of stuff to scan (at <a href="http://www.8days.com/scanning.html">8 days</a>); a big one to shred (at <a href="http://www.officemax.com/home/custom.jsp?id=m4510117&amp;csRedirectSearchString=shredding%20services&amp;csSearchTag=true&amp;csRedirectSearchResultCount=888888">OfficeMax</a>) and a big one to toss (at the dumpster).<br /><br />Here is our 15 box plan:<br />- 4 for clothes (1 each) <br />- 2 for toys <br />- 2 for keepsakes<br />- 1 for games<br />- 1 for homeschool<br />- 1 for books<br />- 1 for kitchen stuff<br />- 1 for tools<br />- 1 for crafts<br />- 1 more<br /><br />We are officially <a href="http://www.mahina.com/consult/index.html">Mahina</a> clients.<br />&nbsp; <br />67 days
