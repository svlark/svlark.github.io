Turtles-- those cute, sweet, little things!  Who can imagine a world without them? Unfortunately, due to many different causes
that world may become a reality unless we do something about it. You can make a difference, all you have to do is try.

I  Lemonade
thursday 5/1/2019
Me, mom, and Lorelei hauled our stuff over to  the office where some of our first customers were already waiting. 
Soon we were busy pouring lemonade. I handed a glass of lemonade to a lady in a pink shirt and then turned to the next person.
She pressed a five dollar bill into my hand and said “Here. I’ll donate the other four because you are such sweet girls doing such good 
things.”  “Thank you so much!” I said, and handed her a cup of lemonade. It made me feel so good inside. It made me realize you get 
happiness in return for what you give away.


II Turtle Hospital
We went to the turtle hospital to donate the money we raised with the lemonade stand. While we were there we went on a tour and learned 
about all the patients they have. My favorite was an Olive Ridley sea turtle. He was so cute! He was the only Olive Ridley sea turtle
they had, and he most likely dragged in fishing nets over here from somewhere on the other side of the world. They didn’t know what
species he was until they did a flipper skin test.  

The turtle hospital in Marathon, Florida is one of the largest in the world. Ithas over 60 patients, and releases turtles back into 
the wild weekly. The top three reasons why they receive patients are boat strikes which cause Bubble butt syndrome, which is when turtles
have air stuck in their shells and they can’t dive to eat or escape boats. Impaction which is caused by eating trash, it gives them gas 
which means they can’t dive, and it also gives them a false feeling of being full. The third reason is tumors which are caused by 
pollution in the water, damaging turtles’ immune systems. The turtles that have these tumors often can’t swim or see because the tumors 
affect their eyes and fins. The criteria for releasing a turtle are that they have to have one good eye, they need three good fins, 
and to be able to dive.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

1.Research
Become aware of turtles and their situation, and find ways to keep trash out of our oceans
2.Spread the Knowledge 
Write letters to friends, fishing companies, and neighbors 
3.Reduce
Use reusable bags at the shopping market and try to reduce the amount of trash you produce.
