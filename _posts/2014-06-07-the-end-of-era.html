<br />Our poor Subaru was totaled after being crushed by a delivery truck. We had had her for over 10 years. She was still in great shape too. Well, except for the being smushed part! Even though it seems sad, it might have been a blessing in disguise. The accident happened right before we needed to get rid of a car anyway. Plus, the insurance company sent us a big check that pays for the rest of our boat! Yeah!<br /><div><br /></div><div>We will miss you little Bean, but thanks for your sacrifice!</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vLyJCR9kTgY/U5FJ9XQQ5iI/AAAAAAAAbp8/9YVfzc5WIqA/s1600/April+and+Jacob+with+the+Suburu.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vLyJCR9kTgY/U5FJ9XQQ5iI/AAAAAAAAbp8/9YVfzc5WIqA/s1600/April+and+Jacob+with+the+Suburu.JPG" height="480" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Me and Jacob ten years ago with our new car</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dpcx-aoadFc/U5FKLMjPFcI/AAAAAAAAbqE/PUBzpQh9K3o/s1600/April+with+the+Suburu.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dpcx-aoadFc/U5FKLMjPFcI/AAAAAAAAbqE/PUBzpQh9K3o/s1600/April+with+the+Suburu.JPG" height="640" width="480" /></a></div><div><br /></div>
