I got really interested in unstayed rigs, in particular cat ketches. &nbsp;They may not &nbsp;be the first ones to round the windward buoy, but they may well be the first to make landfall on a tradewind passage, no to mention the much greater simplicity of handling the rig in the general. &nbsp;There are a number of &nbsp;interesting and realistically priced boats out there including Freedoms and Tantons.<br /><br />I forgot to take&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Modern_Cruising_Sailboat_A_Complete.html?id=88OrMVCYf5cC">TMCS</a>&nbsp;for Thanksgiving, but have since&nbsp;gotten back to Chapter 6. <br />
