I picked up a bunch of stuff we need for the house fix-up list: a light fixture for the kitchen; towel ring for the upstairs bathroom; slides for the kitchen drawer; locking knob for the front door; flat white interior paint. <br /><br />Audrey did a great job with lessons 50 and 51 tonight.  We've finally broken out of the morse code business from the first 50 lessons.<br /><br />My withholding went up $3900 this year.  Can't wait to stop working for a paycheck...
