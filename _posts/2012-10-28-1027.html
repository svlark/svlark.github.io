Audrey and I did the first lesson from <u>Teach Your Child to Read</u>. &nbsp;She was pretty bored by the whole thing. &nbsp;Or so I thought. &nbsp;I drew her some learning-to-write paper for the writing part of the lesson. &nbsp;You know the kind where the solid lines are spaced an inch and a half apart and have a dashed line between them? &nbsp;Well anyway, 10 minutes after we wrapped the lesson up, she was sitting at the table drawing herself some writing paper with solid and dashed lines. &nbsp;Funny kid. <br /><br />Lew Rockwell reminded me of something that needs to go on our todo list to be taken care of ASAP: We need to get our passports squared away. &nbsp;It's not going to be getting any easier to get passports any time soon. <br /><br />We finished <u>The Capable Cruiser</u>. &nbsp;Next up:&nbsp;<u>It's Your Boat Too</u>.<br /><br />-11.5
