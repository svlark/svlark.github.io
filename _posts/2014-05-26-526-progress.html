Well we never get done all we've planned, but things are definitely starting to look better in the garage and we have 7 of our bins packed and sealed.&nbsp; <u>Lots</u> still to do:&nbsp; bins to finish packing; garage sale this weekend; dumping what remains; figuring out how to ship our stuff; figuring out where to live on land for a couple months while we fix some deck leaks and stuff aboard; figuring out how to get the liability coverage I'll probably need for the marina; figuring out how to tow the jeep; etc., etc., etc..
