We're moving.&nbsp; No, we didn't sell the house.&nbsp; We're moving domains.&nbsp; We'll be blogging on svlark.com in a couple days.&nbsp; "Windward Reach" has meaning for us, but I do think it is just a little too obvious, don't you?&nbsp; Why Lark?&nbsp; I don't know, April just loves that name, so Lark it is.&nbsp; Now, if we can only find her...<br /><br />I got email from Sara, of <a href="http://www.svwondertime.com/">Wondertime</a>, about the NZ visa questions.&nbsp; That was a thrill!&nbsp; She said that the biggest factor in their success, was Michael's profession being on the <a href="http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/063ECB35-F5D5-44D8-8325-7041A727A9D5/0/INZ109311February2013.pdf">long-term skill shortage list</a>, which is awesome, as mine and April's both are too.<br /><br />Funny how we have secret cruising celebrities.&nbsp; We get starstruck by emails from Sara, Behan, or Pat, and follow breathlessly the adventures of Sara, Michael, Leah, and Holly; Behan, Jamie, Niall, Mairen, and Siobhan; Pat, Ali, Ouest, and Lowe; Mike, Alissa, Elias, and Eric; Jen, Bruce, Carmen, and Richard.&nbsp; I bet you've never heard of them, but they're our Kardashians.
