This is our last month at Harbortown in Fort Pierce.  There are 3 weekends between now and the end of the month.  Six days to get things settled here and move elsewhere.  I think we can do it. We may end up staying through the next weekend to make it reasonable.

We are due for yet more reduction of stuff.  We have a locker full of almost everything we brought from Colorado which we are going to try to get rid of
