Audrey did a nice job with lesson 86 today. &nbsp;Yesterday, she wrote down her first original sentence: "Yer the gratist mom." <br /><br />Lorelei made it through her first day without a potty accident. &nbsp;That's a big first. &nbsp;It will certainly help with selling the house not to have a smelly diaper pail in her room.<br /><br />We got a bunch of the decor items that the staging consultant recommended. &nbsp;I've often thought how strange it is to fix up a house only when you're trying to leave it. &nbsp;So of course I wanted to see what that was like.<br /><br />I dropped off 5 boxes of old papers at the transfer station that we had cleared out of the office this weekend and 90 gallons (in 3 30 gallon trash bags) of other junk from the garage. &nbsp;April also took 5 boxes of old kid stuff down the hill. &nbsp;Every box and bag we get rid of feels like a weight off of my shoulders. &nbsp;It makes me think of those boats at <a href="http://windwardreach.blogspot.com/2012/09/lessons-from-cabo.html">Cabo</a>&nbsp;which were able to abandon their ground tackle and get away relatively unscathed. <br /><br />230.3<br /><br />
