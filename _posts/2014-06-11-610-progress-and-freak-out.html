8 days left.<br /><br />Crazy to look at all the stuff that's still here that needs to go away.<br /><br />We dodged a bullet on that landlady. &nbsp;She called in the midst of a manic episode just in time for us to stop payment on the check that would have committed us to sharing a wall with a full-on nut job with a key to our home. &nbsp;Only problem is we still have nowhere to live in Ft. Pierce. &nbsp;There's always the boat of course...<br /><br /><br />
