Audrey did lessons 83, 84 and 85 in the last couple days, and has been reading me some Frog and Toad. &nbsp;We also started our Kumon simple addition book.<br /><br />April and I made good progress on the final office clean-up. &nbsp;We also did a purge of the kitchen cabinets so they're looking a lot nicer now. &nbsp;Tomorrow, we will get the garage to 2-car parkability.<br /><br />230.5
