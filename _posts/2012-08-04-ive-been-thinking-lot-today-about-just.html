I've been thinking a lot today about just how to do this -- how to swing the finances? &nbsp;how to execute on the plan? &nbsp;strategies for success?<br /><br />Probably the biggest thing that occurred to me is this-- &nbsp;I want to take specific, concrete steps toward voyaging with my family every day until it happens. &nbsp;My intention is to do that and blog about each day's progress. <br /><br />Another strategy that occurred to me is to envision us in the midst of glorious success -- say, making landfall at Hiva Oa after a 3-week crossing from the Canal -- and working back from there. &nbsp;What will we have done in those 3 weeks? &nbsp;What challenges will we have encountered and overcome? &nbsp;The girls will have had a great experience and will be starting to be distinctly salty. &nbsp;They will have learned about astronomy, navigation, physics, history, finances, sealife. &nbsp;We will all be new shellbacks. &nbsp;How will we have prepared? &nbsp;What will we have brought along? &nbsp;What will we have purchased and repaired and planned and done in advance? &nbsp;It's not that I expect to be able to plan the thing in minute detail, just that I hope that by looking at it from another angle I will have shed light on aspects that I might otherwise overlook. &nbsp;So maybe I'll attempt a series of posts about the crossing I hope to make and see what comes of that.<br /><br />Still no brilliant insights on swinging the finances, but I do have a number of half-baked ideas swimming around. &nbsp;In a post in the not-too-distant future, I'll get them down in writing which will hopefully help me bake them a little more. In the meantime, here's a great collection of real cruisers' accounts of their expenses:&nbsp;<a href="http://thegiddyupplan.blogspot.com/2011/04/cost-of-cruising.html" style="background-color: white; color: #6699cc; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.4; text-decoration: none;">http://thegiddyupplan.blogspot.com/2011/04/cost-of-cruising.html</a><br /><br />So, today's concrete steps? &nbsp;It's early days, so I'm going to go ahead and take credit for reading through Behan's account of the 20-day crossing from Mexico to the Marquesas as having been highly instructive and inspiring. &nbsp;Also, lots of informative browsing and data-gathering on the web today. &nbsp;And, of course, writing this post, an exercise which, if nothing else, bolsters my resolve, but hey, maybe some financing could someday come of having written this here little blog.<br /><br />Finally, some more great new links I've come across today:<br /><ul style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20px; list-style-image: initial; list-style-position: initial; margin: 0.5em 0px; padding: 0px 2.5em;"><li><a href="http://forgeover.com/about-the-crew">http://forgeover.com/about-the-crew</a></li><li><a href="http://sv-totem.blogspot.com/2012/03/what-do-you-need-to-go-cruising-start.html" style="color: #6699cc; line-height: 1.4; text-decoration: none;">sv-totem.blogspot.com/2012/03/what-do-you-need-to-go-cruising-start.html</a></li><li><a href="http://sv-totem.blogspot.com/2012/02/sailing-farm.html" style="color: #6699cc; line-height: 1.4; text-decoration: none;">sv-totem.blogspot.com/2012/02/sailing-farm.html</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theplastiki.com/" style="color: #6699cc; line-height: 1.4; text-decoration: none;">www.theplastiki.com/</a></li><li><a href="http://interviewwithacruiser.blogspot.com/" style="color: #6699cc; line-height: 1.4; text-decoration: none;">http://interviewwithacruiser.blogspot.com</a></li></ul><div><br /></div>
