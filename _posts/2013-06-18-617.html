Audrey and April did a couple pages of Spelling Workout A today and Audrey and I did Lessons 2.7 and 2.8 in our Singapore Math book A.&nbsp; Lorelei is getting pretty good with some colors and is getting lots of repetitions with letter names and sounds.&nbsp; She really wants to read like her sister so we tried again with her with TYCTR yesterday, but she's just not quite ready for that yet.&nbsp; Soon, though...<br /><br />Thanks for the nice blog comments, Mom.
