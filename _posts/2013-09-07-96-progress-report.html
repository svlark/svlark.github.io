Some new cruising books came.&nbsp; I put a good dent in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1456310038/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Buy, Outfit, Sail: How To Inexpensively and Safely Buy, Outfit, and Sail a Small Vessel Around the World</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />We put in a solid week of schoolwork with the girls.<br /><br />We finally reached a decision on the RV thing.&nbsp; We're going to find a modest apartment with a 6-month lease and skip the RV at least for now.&nbsp; It might be a bit cheaper, but it would be a lot more stressful and not in any way that particularly advances our ultimate goals.&nbsp; In short, we felt it was likely to become a big distraction from actually sailing away.<br /><br />
