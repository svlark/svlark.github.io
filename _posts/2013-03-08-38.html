Len finished up the mudroom bench and shelves. &nbsp;They look really great. &nbsp;Len and April got the fridge really nicely cleaned up. &nbsp;We got the new bi-fold door in on the upstairs bathroom. &nbsp;We also got rid of those chintzy shoe racks. &nbsp;I had Nick the plumber in to look at the upstairs shower and he said he'd do the job for $50 plus parts. &nbsp;And he'll also help me with hauling away refuse with his truck for $50. &nbsp;So good deals, I think<br /><br />Tomorrow we'll work on the new window sill; replacing the downstairs medicine cabinet; replacing the laundry room bi-folds; and replacing the kitchen flooring. &nbsp;The garage is getting really chaotic at this point with 17 projects in varying stages of completed-ness and a million things we've moved out but not decided what to do with.<br /><br />Audrey did great on lesson 76. <br /><br />235.6
