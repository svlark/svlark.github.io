The girls have started a new swimming class at <a href="http://www.oceanfirstdivers.com/">Ocean First Diving in Boulder</a>. It is great so far! It is really focused on water safety, which I love. I have been thinking a lot about the new safety challenges we will face living on a boat. Instead of worrying about jumping off our deck and rolling down the mountain, we will have to think about falling over board and into the ocean. I think being proficient swimmers and really understanding ways to stay safe in the water is a good step. They really work on fun ways for the kids to remember to roll over on their backs and float if they fall in, and get to the edge as quickly as possible. Audrey was floating on her back by herself, and in Lorelei's class we practiced climbing out alone (elbow, elbow, tummy, knee, knee) and monkey hand walking around the edge.
