<span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I must apologize for this post in advance. &nbsp;I know that one shouldn't bring up the drone wars in polite company but I've been stewing about this and finally had to put it down:</span></span><br /><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I've had something on my mind and it's got me really confused. &nbsp;This president kills and maims innocent men, women, and children on the other side of the world casually and frequently. &nbsp;Like on a weekly basis. &nbsp;Everyone knows this, yet everyone is thrilled that he'll have 4 more years to continue to kill at his leisure. &nbsp;Why is this good news? &nbsp;The man is known to personally maintain a "kill list" including American citizens who have never been tried or convicted of anything. &nbsp;Children too! &nbsp;I just can't get my head around it. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Maybe I'm just not patriotic enough. &nbsp;Anyway, I clearly don't belong here.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">-15.9</span></div>
