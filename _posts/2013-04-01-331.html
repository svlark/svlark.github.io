Well, not our most productive weekend in terms of preparing for this sale, but we made some good headway on clearing out and cleaning up per our stager's guidance.  <br /><br />Audrey continues to crank through these TYCTR lessons.  She read us lesson 91 this morning. <br /><br />We are getting lots of inspiration from South from Alaska.<br />
