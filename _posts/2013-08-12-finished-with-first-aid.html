We finished our online study for first aid, and Tuesday evening we'll do the hands-on part.<br><br>We memorized "Some One" by Walter de la Mare this week.&nbsp; We'll need to pick out a new one for this week.&nbsp;<br><br>Audrey's doing the last of her summer camps this week, so we'll be planning for our regular schedule to start probably next week.&nbsp; <br><br>There's a reasonably priced Nautor 40 that looks really cool, and much more do-able for April and I handle on our own than that big old Olympic 47 we love.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.yachtworld.com/core/listing/boatMergedDetails.jsp?boat_id=2462614&amp;checked_boats=2462614&amp;ybw=&amp;units=Feet&amp;currency=USD&amp;access=Public&amp;listing_id=79363&amp;url=&amp;imc=pg-fs">This one</a> is really a beauty, though she'd be pretty cozy.
