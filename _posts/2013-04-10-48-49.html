We're so ridiculously busy that I'm having trouble finding time to blog.  <br /><br />At D-9, we're spending each evening getting a different room to final show-ability along with restoring show-ability in each room we've  previously done.  <br /><br />In the meantime we have new roommates, Melissa and Keegan, the capoeiristo painters, who have been spending the days here with us since Thursday.  Tomorrow, Matt the handyman will be joining the 6 of us and our 2 dogs here at the house for a couple days of odd jobs.<br /><br />226.6
