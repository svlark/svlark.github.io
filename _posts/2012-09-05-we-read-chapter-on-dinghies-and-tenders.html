We read the chapter on dinghies and tenders from <u>The Capable Cruiser</u>&nbsp;tonight. &nbsp;Takeaways:<br /><br /><ul><li>In Baja, South Pacific, and the Indian Ocean, cruisers spend ~85% of their time at anchor.</li><li>Inflatables&nbsp;</li><ul><li>are more stable which is nice for climbing aboard from the water (after snorkeling, say) and for loading heavy supplies like water.</li><li>Sitting on the side makes for a wet butt.</li><li>Get punctured by rocks, coral, dogs.</li><li>Take a long time to inflate costing precious minutes if you go aground and need to kedge your boat off before the ebb tide. &nbsp;(What's kedging?)</li><li>Can get blown out to sea if the motor fails (very difficult to row to into the wind)</li></ul><li>Hard boats</li><ul><li>Are more easily rowed, even to into the wind.</li><li>Can be rigged with sails.</li><li>Are much sturdier.</li><li>Are much bulkier.</li><li>Are heavier.</li><li>Are quickly deployed.</li><li>Can be made more stable with the addition of a flotation collar</li></ul><li>Also look at porta-botes.</li></ul><div>Question: &nbsp;Do davits rule out windvanes? &nbsp;What's the difference between a windvane and an autopilot?</div>
