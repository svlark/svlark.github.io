Audrey and I played number-bond cards.&nbsp; With a deck of fours sets of cards from 0 to 10, we each pick a number, also from 0 to 10, and grab pairs of cards adding up to our number.&nbsp; Of course, the person with the higher number always wins, though she hasn't realized that yet.&nbsp; She just loves consistently beating me.<br><br>We also reviewed the meaning of first, second, and third person, and singular and plural, and reviewed our memorized lists of first person singular and plural personal pronouns.&nbsp; She's got them all down pat.<br><br>We read the first section of the chapter on ancient Americans from  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fXDcjwYFVzQC">SotWV1</a>on the Nazca lines.&nbsp; What an amazing thing!&nbsp; We answered review questions and Audrey gave dictation and copied what she told me in summary.<br><br>We reviewed "Devotion" by Robert Frost at dinner.&nbsp; I think we've all got that one pretty well now. <br><br>April read Lo Tiki Tiki Tembo for school, and I snuck in for cuddles.<br><br>We read aloud the story of the Eight Immortals going to sea from <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Cloud_Weavers.html?id=rMx3PQAACAAJ">Cloud Weavers: Ancient Chinese Legends</a>, a chapter from <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kM93eXPpto4C&amp;dq=on%20the%20other%20side%20of%20the%20hill&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks">Little Town in the Ozarks</a>, and Audrey read aloud Chapter 8 from <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BZo7RwPS0MsC&amp;dq=magic%20treehouse%20knight&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks">The Knight at Dawn</a>. <br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RONAk8iKrWA/UyPbx9wfKkI/AAAAAAAAbU8/1hypJtvHxh4/s640/blogger-image-1659203567.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RONAk8iKrWA/UyPbx9wfKkI/AAAAAAAAbU8/1hypJtvHxh4/s640/blogger-image-1659203567.jpg"></a></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4xj5Qtq83k0/UyPb0dXuqBI/AAAAAAAAbVE/_qeUBIVCLFQ/s640/blogger-image-13445724.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4xj5Qtq83k0/UyPb0dXuqBI/AAAAAAAAbVE/_qeUBIVCLFQ/s640/blogger-image-13445724.jpg"></a></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QkIJb4adIKI/UyPb2jd38BI/AAAAAAAAbVM/9I4n2dkjHQE/s640/blogger-image--950185953.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QkIJb4adIKI/UyPb2jd38BI/AAAAAAAAbVM/9I4n2dkjHQE/s640/blogger-image--950185953.jpg"></a></div>
