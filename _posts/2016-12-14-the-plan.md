We have been so vague about our plans, because we don’t really know ourselves. As we have posted, we are attempting to sell Lark, and hoping to find a Lark 2.0 to continue our sailing journey. While the boat is on the market, we have decided to do a few things that we have not had the opportunity to do while sailing through one tropical paradise after another. 

So far, we have driven through the Great Smokey Mountains to Chicago, and spent a couple of months there with friends and family. After Chicago, we drove to Boulder to spend some time with more friends and family. It was a short trip, but we had to rush off to our next stop in order for Jacob to get settled in before starting a new job. He works remotely, but needs to make sure the internet is up to snuff, and if it isn’t he has to straighten it out with time to spare.

We love cousin Zach! 

We've spent 5 weeks now in Fernie, British Columbia, hitting the road again this weekend. It has been a great stay! We are definitely experiencing winter here!

The ski hill opened and everyone is loving it! It is an amazing hill! We have had some of the best powder days ever, and it is early season! We are just sorry we can't stay longer to enjoy it more!

We have been mostly using Airbnb.com to organize our travels, and have a couple of months in the future booked. At this point we are booked for Blaine, Washington and Comox, British Columbia, taking us through the end of February. Hopefully both stops will involve both boat shopping and lots of skiing.

So, that’s what we have been up to, and as much of our plan as we know at this point. We’ll keep you posted!
