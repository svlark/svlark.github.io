Yesterday marked 2 months we’ve been in the Bahamas.  It’s the longest I’ve ever been outside the US.  We’ve spent a week in West End, a night at Great Sale, a night at Powell, a month at Green Turtle, 2 weeks in Marsh Harbour, and most of a week at Man-o-War.

And we’ve been in Hope Town this past week.  It’s a fun spot— very scenic.  Surrounding the harbor is the settlement, full of cute little cottages painted in pastel colors.  Standing over the harbor is the 120-foot Elbow Reef Light— the last manually-operated kerosene lighthouse in the world.  The beaches on both sides are spectacularly beautiful, with all the shades of blue and green you’d expect in the Abacos.  

I’m feeling so fortunate to be getting to experience it all over the course of months, as we are, rather than having to fit it all in to a week or two.  It’s been great!
