I spoke with the Dockmaster and Harbortown and got a different slip lined up.&nbsp; Our current slip has only an 11-foot finger making it very difficult to board without backing in, bur backing in means very little privacy for us in our living room, er, cockpit.&nbsp; So we're going to a slip with a 22-foot finger this weekend.&nbsp; It will be my first experience at the helm and April's of docking and line-handling.
