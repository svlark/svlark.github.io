I have really been struggling to keep up my daily accountability to the blog. &nbsp;I'll get back on the horse...<br /><br />But anyway. &nbsp; Audrey continues to make great progress on TYCTRI100L. &nbsp;She blew through lesson 82 this evening. <br /><br />We've gotten Mike and Alisa through the Marquesas and into the Tuamotus. &nbsp;He's a really good writer. &nbsp;Really interesting new posts from him recently on thelifegalactic.blogspot.com.<br /><br />229.3
