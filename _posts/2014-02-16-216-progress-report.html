We just returned from a wonderfully relaxing winter break on the beach in FL with Mom and Dad. &nbsp;We had an up-close look inside and out at a Reliance 44; a Catalina 42; a Gulfstar 40; an Island Packet 38; a Passport 42; a Tayana Vancouver 42; a CT 47; and an Ericson 37. &nbsp;We'll write a series of posts capturing our thoughts on each and what we learned from them. &nbsp;For now though, it's bedtime-- school starts again in 9 hours!
