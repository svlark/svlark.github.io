I finished taking a photographic inventory of all out stuff in the house and the garage.&nbsp; We'll sit down and go through these couple hundred pictures and make preliminary decisions about what will come with us.<br /><br />Meantime, April made initial contact with some estate sellers about cleaning us out of the rest.<br /><br />I've been in touch with a seller about his cat ketch.&nbsp; I really like the boats, in particular for the tradewind passages we have in mind.<br /><br />April also discovered the apartment complex thinks we have a 12-month lease, so we'll have to sort that out.&nbsp;<br /><br />98 days.&nbsp; I think.
