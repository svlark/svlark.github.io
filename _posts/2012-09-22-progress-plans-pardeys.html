I finally completed the first pass on thinning out our books. &nbsp;Eventually, we'll need to get it down to fewer than 50 books (including manuals, boating references, homeschooling books, and local guides) when we move aboard, and that may be high. &nbsp;In the first pass I've pulled out a couple hundred. &nbsp;Now I need to get actually get rid of them.<div><br /></div><div>Our goals for the next week are:</div><div><ol><li>Move kiddy clothes.</li><li>Move books.</li><li>Move furniture</li><li>Have a brainstorming session on ways to sustain financially once we're out, and identify next steps.</li><li>Start scheduling flooring, cabinet, window treatment, and gutter guys to come give us estimates. &nbsp;Not that we're necessarily going to do any of that, but I just want to know what they'll say.</li></ol><div>Last night we read&nbsp;"Cut the Shouting Out of Sailing" in the <u>The Capable Cruiser</u>. &nbsp;They had some good advice, but it was funny because despite the title, one of the main items was basically: "Ladies, don't take it personally when you get yelled at. &nbsp;Men are just like that." &nbsp;OK, I'm taking it out of context a little, but we chuckled. &nbsp;Otherwise the main points were these:</div></div><div><ol><li>Using actual nautical terms for things is worthwhile because it can be less ambiguous than using everyday vernacular.</li><li>The skipper and crew to should discuss in advance the skipper's plans for things like landing or casting off maneuvers.</li><li>The skipper and crew should have a checklist for things like casting off and should check all of the items themselves.</li><li>Eliminate distractions during involved and potentially risky maneuvers, again, like landing or casting off.</li><li>Consider dry runs for new or complicated maneuvers.</li><li>There is only skipper (at a time) and his or her orders are to be carried out without discussion. &nbsp;Post mortem later if necessary.</li><li>Crew should repeat the skipper's orders.</li><li>Shout, if necessary, to be heard.</li></ol><div>Good stuff generally.</div><div><br /></div><div>All indications (and I won't elaborate on that) are that my crawlspace efforts earlier in the week were effective. &nbsp;I can tell you, it's making a huge difference to my state of mind already.</div></div>
