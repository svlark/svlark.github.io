I put a good dent in packing tools and going through unopened boxes from the last move.&nbsp;<br /><br />The big puzzle of the moment, besides where to go, is what to do about internet access which is especially important in my current job. I need 200G per month at a bare minimum.&nbsp; 400 would be much more comfortable.&nbsp; If we can find somewhere with Comcast I'm golden.&nbsp; If need be I can use my Verizon Jetpack as a stopgap which provides excellent speeds on 4g LTE, but costs $5/G, which is obviously not sustainable.&nbsp;<br /><br />More good stuff from both Fluenta and Hotspur today.<br /><br /><br />
