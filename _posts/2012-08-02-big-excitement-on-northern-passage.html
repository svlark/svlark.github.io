Bruce, Jen, and the kids encountered rough seas in Cook Inlet &nbsp;on July 13 (or maybe 7/31) and lived to <a href="http://www.sailnorthernpassage.com/2012/07/serenity-and-storms-bravery-and-peace.html">tell the tale</a>. &nbsp;Awesome!<br /><br />The comments are kind of funny too. &nbsp;Jen's mom is just about ready to call up NOAA and lodge a complaint about the weather.<br /><br />Makes me realize another thing that needs to go onto the <a href="http://windwardreach.blogspot.com/p/to-do.html">To do list</a>: I need to seek out experience handling a vessel in rough conditions. &nbsp;I wonder if there are training programs for that. &nbsp;Can you recommend any?<br /><br />
