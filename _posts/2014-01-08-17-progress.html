We read from <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wcaR-diN5osC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">Essentials</a>.<br /><br />We've been doing some research on digitizing old printed photos.&nbsp; We can do that for a couple hundred bucks for 1000 prints through <a href="http://www.scancafe.com/services/valuekit-product/?cid=GOOG&amp;template=1&amp;gclid=CM22tN7u7bsCFcsRMwodjRAArg">ScanCafe</a>.&nbsp; That'll lighten the load.<br /><br />I also researched shipping our dining room set to Len through uShip.&nbsp; That'll be about $350.&nbsp; I think we can do a similar thing with the day bed Dad made for around $100.<br /><br />Over our anniversary trip this past weekend we put a lot of thought into how we will reduce and pack for this next move.&nbsp; Hopefully we'll be able to get down to something reasonable for living aboard.&nbsp; I'll fill in details on those plans soon.
