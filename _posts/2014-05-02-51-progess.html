So we've been struggling mightily to nail down where to go.&nbsp; Of all the candidates we started with several months back we're now down to Puget Sound and southeast Florida.&nbsp; We put together&nbsp; pros and cons for each:<br /><br />Florida<br /><br />Pros<br />- Closer to J's parents and good advice on boat stuff<br />- Close to cruising grounds<br />- Nice live aboard winter weather<br />- Tons of boats<br />- No income tax<br />- Good cost-of-living<br /><br />Cons<br />- Very hot and humid<br />- Boats are more beaten up<br />- Not excellent job market<br />- Hurricanes<br />- Possible bad cultural fit<br />- Work 10-7<br /><br />Seattle<br /><br />Pros<br />- Work 7-4<br />- Lots of boats<br />- Always wanted to spend time there<br />- Great job market<br />- Love the Pacific Northwest<br /><br />Cons<br />- Would see less of J's parents<br />- Long voyage to just get to cruising grounds<br />- Cold winters for living aboard<br />- More expensive rent<br /><br />We've hatched a scheme to reach a decision.&nbsp; Stay tuned.
