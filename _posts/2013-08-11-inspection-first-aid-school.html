I did lots of fix-up work around the grounds today in anticipation of our inspection, with plenty left to do.<br /><br />We did 3 hours of school today.&nbsp; I don't know how that happened.&nbsp; I think as long as I'm working full time during the week, weekends will continue to be prime homeschool time, at least for me.<br /><br />We completed unit 6 on our first aid thing, on frost bit and hypothermia.&nbsp;
