our route today ([on Trip30](https://www.trip30.com/shared/2bb465cd-f04f-4483-96eb-6901c17836bf))

This morning I’m assigned to be the deckmate. My duties include:  

- managing the anchor and windlass
- rigging and stowing the dock lines and fenders
- tending the dinghy scope
- cleaning the dishes and counters
- preparing the cabin for getting underway
- moving halyards at night
- mopping morning dew
- setting mop as boarding mat

My fellow cruiser Robin had finished many of my jobs for me before I was even out of bed today. She was the deckmate yesterday and I guess really liked mopping! I was glad for the help, it gave me extra time to enjoy my coffee. I did manage to tidy lots of lines and fenders throughout the day though.

Robin at the helm

We left port a little earlier today, and had a day of many tacking and jibing drills. We'd take a post on helm, port jib line, starboard jib line and main sheet. We alternated around getting a chance to really understand all of the mechanics between both tacking and jibing. After we finished the maneuver we practiced trimming the sails for whichever point of sail the helmsman was after, including sailing wing on wing for a nice run. I feel that I’m really starting to understand trimming for the point of sail we are on. It’s a nice feeling because I have also taken a backseat in the sailing department on our own boat. Jacob grew up sailing and has always just gotten it. In the past I would mostly try to stay out of the way or do what I was told. Also, today Michelle gave me a little tip that was so helpful. We were sailing on a beam reach and I was on the helm. She said to pay attention to the wind touching my cheek, and if it shifted off of my cheek we were changing our point of sail. It really clicked for me.

sailing wing on wing

At the end of the day we pulled into Reid Harbor off of Stuart Island, and prepared to anchor. We picked a spot, cased the spot and put down our anchor. Then we were all sitting there and feeling like we were too close to another boat. That is not a nice feeling! It would be a pretty rude awakening to be sound asleep in the night, have the wind shift and crash into a boat. So, we pulled the anchor back up (which was not easy given how sore my forearms were from all of the tacks and jibes!), picked a new spot, cased it, and anchored. This time it went much better. We all felt more comfortable.

dinner in the salon

We had one more really cool phenomenon happen. In the middle of the night, while flushing the head, the inside of the bowl started to sparkle! I couldn’t figure it out at first, and had to run to get my glasses in case I was seeing things. It really was sparkling, and when I went out to the cockpit and stirred the water with the boat hook, it sparkled there too. I tried to get a picture of it, but I didn’t bring my fancy camera, and my iPhone just wasn’t up to it. There are bioluminescents here! It is amazing! I have always wanted to see them…I only wish Jacob and the girls were here to witness their swishy flashing lights with me.
