April made great headway today excavating kid clothes to unload. <br /><br />We're going to try again with the first aid class on 12/8. &nbsp;Babysitting fell through last time.<br /><br />We went out this evening with our good friends Valerie and Ian and I picked his brain a little on technical trading, which I've been investigating as one possible component of sustaining. &nbsp;BTW, here's his brand new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Building-Retirement-Portfolio-ebook/dp/B009QHGWDC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350251092&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+5+fundamentals+of+building+a+retirement+portfolio">book</a>. &nbsp;Very interesting stuff...<br /><br />Audrey's getting good with the learning to read primers GranMiri has been sending. &nbsp;Thanks GranMiri!<br /><br />-8.4
