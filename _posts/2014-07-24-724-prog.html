So we'll try to launch a week from Thursday.&nbsp; Before that we'll finish reinstalling zincs; replace the starter battery; get Lark on the transom; get the diesel guy lined up; answer the bilge pump question (there are supposed to be 2, but where?); and complete a radio check.<br /><br />The internet access issue for work has worked out better than I could have imagined.<br /><br />The Verizon Jetpack has proven a nearly certain fallback in the absence of other options.&nbsp; It gets a 4G LTE signal anywhere.&nbsp; It just has the restrictive usage limits and expensive overage charges.&nbsp; But when other options aren't working out and it's critical to prove that technology and infrastructure will not impede work progress, it's great to know that it's there as a fallback.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Xfinity Wifi is all over the place, provides very reasonable bandwidth, and at no additional cost with my existing Comcast Business plan.&nbsp; There's a locator map to find hotpots but I've discovered that there are also many more hotspots that aren't on the map.<br /><br />So that's been great, and now, good night.
