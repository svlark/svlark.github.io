I went down to Ft. Pierce to observe the survey on the Ericson 36c on Friday.&nbsp; It was quite a trip.<br /><br />After winning the TSA lottery and being randomly selected to go through the no-AIS line with only 3 people in front of me, then boarding&nbsp; the plane for Orlando, the flight ended up leaving 2 hours late thanks to a power outage at Frontier's head office.&nbsp; Dad picked me up at 2:30AM and we got in to Melbourne at 4.&nbsp; Thanks for the extremely early pick-up Pop.<br /><br />We headed for Ft. Pierce at 7 Friday morning and found the vessel blocked and ready for the slings at Riverside when we arrived at 8.&nbsp; The seller and broker showed up shortly and Paul the surveyor came next.&nbsp; After rolling out the the main, staysail, and genoa and finding them all in surprisingly nice condition, I got to watch the Travelift pick her up and drop her in, which is something I've never gotten to see before.<br /><br />We spent the next several hours aboard, poking and prodding her all over.&nbsp; The cockpit was really great, especially the aluminum frame and canopy.&nbsp; It was cool to see how comfortably it accommodated 6 people with room to spare.&nbsp; It was really cool to see the electrics and electronics lit up and running.&nbsp; The engine fired right up which was pretty amazing considering it's been in dry storage for a couple years.&nbsp; The air conditioning and refrigeration didn't work which was a bummer.&nbsp; The owner was certain that there were just minor issues with them, but we've asked him to resolve them or make some allowance for their repair.&nbsp; <br /><br />I dropped in at the Dock Master's Office at Harbortown and found that they already had us penciled in <br />to slip 16 on the Fiji dock.&nbsp; We'd actually be even closer to the pool than we are in our current apartment here in CO, which the girls would love.&nbsp; Then we swung by the Fort Pierce City Marina, and I liked it even more.&nbsp; It's got a great location downtown in Fort Pierce right next door to the library and the Saturday Farmers' Market.&nbsp; So we have a couple great options there.<br /><br />On Saturday Mom and Dad and I had a beautiful sail on Dad's Eumelia.&nbsp; After looking like we'd just be going for a nice little motor cruise, the breeze freshened right up and blew reliably out of the northwest for the entire 2 hours we were out.&nbsp; I guess that was actually the first time I've trimmed a sail in a number of years, but it was just as fun as I remember.&nbsp; That's good.<br /><br />What a great visit it was all around, and a great milestone for our project.&nbsp; Thanks Mom and Dad for hosting and driving, and thanks April for soloing with the girls while I was off having fun in the sun.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7wV2qKGzssM/U5VCCvCic3I/AAAAAAAAE7Q/FSEPtuM_z-Y/s640/blogger-image--1022872857.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7wV2qKGzssM/U5VCCvCic3I/AAAAAAAAE7Q/FSEPtuM_z-Y/s640/blogger-image--1022872857.jpg" /></a><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9Pe3vxUP6SY/U5VEGI6JguI/AAAAAAAAE70/7eQJcumao_I/s640/blogger-image--453320856.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9Pe3vxUP6SY/U5VEGI6JguI/AAAAAAAAE70/7eQJcumao_I/s640/blogger-image--453320856.jpg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5XvSZ9xPKGI/U5VEIHjexOI/AAAAAAAAE78/UuUDm_E2JKA/s640/blogger-image--1630886195.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5XvSZ9xPKGI/U5VEIHjexOI/AAAAAAAAE78/UuUDm_E2JKA/s640/blogger-image--1630886195.jpg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CMZfW2t0Iq0/U5VCFxiu9aI/AAAAAAAAE7g/4jFpe9wWy6k/s640/blogger-image--1078316235.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CMZfW2t0Iq0/U5VCFxiu9aI/AAAAAAAAE7g/4jFpe9wWy6k/s640/blogger-image--1078316235.jpg" /></a></div><br />
