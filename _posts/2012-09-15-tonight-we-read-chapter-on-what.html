Tonight we read the chapter from <u>The Capable Cruiser</u> on what happened in Cabo San Lucas on December 7, 1982, when something like 30 vessels were driven onto the beach and destroyed. &nbsp;It was a pretty horrifying thing. <br /><br />The next couple chapters will delve into what went wrong and what could have been done. &nbsp;Just on the basis of this chapter, the lessons are:<br /><br /><ol><li>Always listen to the weather reports, even if you're not planning on going anywhere.</li><li>Always watch your barometer.</li><li>Choose a berth with plenty of room to swing without fouling adjacent vessels' berths.</li><li>Be assertive in defending your berth from those who would anchor too close.</li><li>Develop the seamanship and keep your boat prepared to leave any anchorage under sail.</li><li>Refill on fuel as soon as you arrive.</li><li>Use a fairlead that closes over the top of the chain or rode, so that it can't be yanked free and start doing damage to the pulpit if a rough swell develops at anchor.</li><li>Wear a harness and clip in when working on deck in rough seas, even if it's at anchor.</li></ol><div><br /></div>
