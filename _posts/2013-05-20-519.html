Oh boy, oh boy.&nbsp;<br /><br />So we had another open house today, but no one really came.&nbsp; The showings have tapered off.&nbsp; Well, I guess we'd better settle in for a long slog.&nbsp; It will be good practice for us to maintain the habit of keeping things tidy, and in the meantime we'll get to continue to enjoy all the things we love about the place.&nbsp; <br />
