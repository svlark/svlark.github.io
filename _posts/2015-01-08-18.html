Big blow last night. &nbsp;Everyone in the marina was up at 3 retying dock lines.<div><br></div><div>I did some more spelunking this evening to try to get a handle on the cockpit fiberglass situation, this time from below. What I saw looked surprisingly solid. &nbsp;Not sure what I was expecting but I feel a little better having seen what I did. &nbsp;I still think some tapping is in order as my next step.</div>
