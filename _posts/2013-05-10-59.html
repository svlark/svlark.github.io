We had that showing today, and we have another scheduled for Monday morning. <br /><br />Audrey is a reading machine these days. &nbsp;Mom reminded me about graded readers and we do have some so we pulled them out. &nbsp;We told Audrey that when she can read a book all by herself then it's hers and we'll write her name and date in the cover. &nbsp;That's been pretty motivating. &nbsp;She's scored <a href="http://icanread.com/search/BookDetail.cfm?ISBN13=9780060546601" target="_blank">Mittens</a> and <a href="http://icanread.com/search/BookDetail.cfm?ISBN13=9780061177545" target="_blank">Scat, Cat!</a> and is working on <a href="http://icanread.com/search/BookDetail.cfm?ISBN13=9780061733017" target="_blank">The Too Big Tutu</a>.<br /><br />Still waiting on our Susan Wise Bauer books. &nbsp;They actually haven't even shipped yet. <br /><br />I'm also all fired up to get some Singapore Math books and have a look at them. &nbsp;I think they'll be good for Lo in about a year too.<br /><br />And I can't wait to move aboard.
