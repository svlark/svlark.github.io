We had a great lesson with Cap'n Jack today in our home marina.&nbsp; Not yet on our own boat, but we're getting there.<br /><br />I had a very interesting conversation with Jose the diesel tank guy, as referred from Richard the refitter, as referred from Paul the surveyor.&nbsp; Jose's main recommendation for tracking down my fuel leak is to pour in distilled water with food coloring and see where it comes out.&nbsp; I'll have to give that one a little thought, though I can definitely see the advantages of that over pumping 80 gallons of diesel in to find that leak and the watch my bilge fill up with it.<br /><br />The tank and the engine mounts are definitely the top priorities at this point.&nbsp;<br /><br />I guess what we're going to have to do is to re-up for another month in the condo before moving aboard.&nbsp; Hopefully we'll finally have the engine thing resolved by then.
