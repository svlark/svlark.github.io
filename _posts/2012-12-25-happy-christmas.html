Happy Christmas everyone!  I gave myself leave to miss the last couple days, as you can tell.  <br /><br />My favorite Christmas song this year has been Christmas on Christmas Island. Though there are at least 2 Christmas Islands so I'm not sure which one the song refers to, but I'll take either.  <br /><br />I forgot to weigh this morning but I'm certainly up.  I'll get back on top of it.
