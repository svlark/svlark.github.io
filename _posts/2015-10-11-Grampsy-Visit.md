Grampsy’s had his last visit to Ft. Pierce for a while. My Dad really likes the condo he always stays in when he visits us in Ft. Pierce! It is in a community right on the beach with 5 swimming pools and a tiki bar….hard to go wrong! Every time he is here the girls always spend lots of nights having sleepovers with Grampsy, and playing in the pool. We have all grown pretty attached over the past year!
