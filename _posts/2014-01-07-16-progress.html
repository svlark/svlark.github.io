We've been making progress in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fgtXO9LyROoC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">Sell Up and Sail</a> and in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wcaR-diN5osC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">The Essentials of Living Aboard a Boat</a>.&nbsp; We've also done some good concrete planning on reducing and relocating.&nbsp; The countdown is on for us in CO!
