We went to the marine flea market in Vero today. &nbsp;It was kind of weird. &nbsp;Honestly, it was mostly souped up cars and funnel cake vendors. &nbsp;There was one &nbsp;guy with actual boat stuff, and we were able to get a pretty good deal on an extra set of braided dock lines.<div><br></div><div>Cap'n Jack came by and suggested that when I need to do some grinding for this fiberglass project, that I can just take the boat to the anchorage right outside the marina and grind away. &nbsp;If it's going to take awhile then so much the better: we can develop our life-on-the-hook skills out there and dinghy in and out from our slip.</div>
