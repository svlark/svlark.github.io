We spent pretty much the entire day working on 100 square feet of kitchen floor. &nbsp;We're about a third done with it. &nbsp;Turns out flooring is kinda labor-intensive.<br /><br />Audrey read her first new story in normal orthography. &nbsp;The last couple were repeats of stories we'd read previously with Siegfried's fancy letters. &nbsp;It went surprisingly well, though a bit of a struggle at times. <br /><br />The hardest part of this whole learning to read thing for me is how she can read a word perfectly the first time she sees it and then struggle with it in the next line. &nbsp;I guess it's just part of the process. &nbsp;But literally today there was a sentence with "far, far" and the second "far" was really challenging, while the first didn't give her a second's hesitation. &nbsp;Crazy.<br /><br />I might be a believer in un-schooling. &nbsp;Since about lesson 20 I've abandoned pushing Audrey on this thing in any way. &nbsp;We only do it if she chooses to when I invite her to, and I always offer that we can set it aside for the moment if she gets really frustrated, but she almost always chooses to push through.<br /><br />235.2
