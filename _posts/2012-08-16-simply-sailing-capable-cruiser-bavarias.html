What a great book&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=S6xQLwEACAAJ&amp;dq=simply+sailing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P6Jo0-4Mjz&amp;sig=ckxX8JUhpA-eeF3ZePVpcn-I5X8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RGwsUOYnpLHJAejYgbgO&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ">Simply Sailing: A Different Approach to a Life of Adventure</a>&nbsp;is! &nbsp;I haven't gotten my hands on the full book yet, only samples on Google Books, but from those samples I can tell this book is going to be a real treat. &nbsp;It's written in nice little bite-sized chapters that are about 1/3 practical knowledge and 2/3 narrative from the author's cruising experiences with her husband and 3 sons (!) aboard their 34-foot (!) cutter. &nbsp;But wait, that's not all! Connie and Dave also run the excellent site,&nbsp;<a href="http://simplysailingonline.com/ssabout.php">http://simplysailingonline.com</a>&nbsp;with lots of great information on all aspects of the project from homeschooling to maintenance to recipes.<br /><br />April and I are reading The Capable Cruiser aloud to each other. &nbsp;What fun!<br /><br />What's up with <a href="http://www.cruisingworld.com/sailboats/boat-reviews/bavarias-cruiser-32-36-40-and-45-a-german-american-alliance">Bavarias</a>? &nbsp;They seem to have a reputation as simultaneously chintzy and pretentious, but are they seaworthy? &nbsp;I assume not, but I haven't seen a review that addresses it specifically, but hey, if they're good boats, I'm unpretentious enough to not care who thinks my boat is pretentious!
