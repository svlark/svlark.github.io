I got our remote first aid book today, so we'll get started on reading that tonight.&nbsp; The course is just a couple weeks off now.&nbsp; It'll be in Denver for 4 hours on a Tuesday and Thursday evening and on the following Saturday from 8 to 5.<br /><br />There's lots more ready to be done now:&nbsp; We have a house full of stuff to sell, give away, and/or store as we begin to downsize in earnest.&nbsp; We need to get the ball rolling on passports, and begin to research travel and work visas and quarantine issues. Work visas will require lots of concrete documentation of work history.&nbsp; We need to start to get more specific about cruising finances and sustainability.&nbsp; I need to learn lots more about system maintenance and repair -- fiberglass, sails, through-hulls, diesel, rigging electronics, etc., etc..<br /><br />
