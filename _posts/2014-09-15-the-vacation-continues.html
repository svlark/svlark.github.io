Our initial move aboard date has come and gone, and we are still living in a vacation rental on South Hutchinson Island. After discovering that the engine work would most likely require us to move off for a week or two we decided to extend our stay at Ocean Village for a month and try and get the work done first. <br /><br />It is nice to have a little more time to get things done. I still haven't finished the sheets yet! I keep debating about whether to use nice cotton or linen.&nbsp; I just need to make a decision and move on it! I also need to find some nice compressed foam to make a new bed for us out of. Ours has had quite a bit of water damage, and I'm pretty sure it needs replacing.<br /><br />We are getting a little more comfortable with the idea of actually taking Lark out sometime in the near future! We put up her sails, and discovered a couple of spots where they need to be repaired, but they are small, and I think I can probably manage it myself. Jacob and I have both had solo maneuvering lessons aboard too.&nbsp; I took her out of the slip, down the fairway and into the river. I turned her several times and then brought her back to the slip. I backed her in by pointing her bow at the boat kitty corner to us, and using the prop-walk to bring her in. It all went surprisingly smoothly! It definitely helps to have calm-and-collected Captain Jack there to coach me along the way.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h_VpoU2LbmQ/VBenp5vYy0I/AAAAAAAAco8/VpG4-kR2Mpc/s1600/IMG_2024.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h_VpoU2LbmQ/VBenp5vYy0I/AAAAAAAAco8/VpG4-kR2Mpc/s1600/IMG_2024.jpg" height="640" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9LRluQ6wvbM/VBendLkJIZI/AAAAAAAAcok/Tom1Zx0-lKo/s1600/IMG_2011.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9LRluQ6wvbM/VBendLkJIZI/AAAAAAAAcok/Tom1Zx0-lKo/s1600/IMG_2011.jpg" height="480" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">hanging out on the water with Captain Jack</td></tr></tbody></table>In other news, along with starting back to own-schooling, the girls and I have also started participating in some <a href="http://www.parents-etc.com/">Parent's Educating on the Treasure Coast</a> events. We went to their back to school bash, which was a nice way to connect with some other homeschooling families. I also volunteered to teach one of their co-op classes and that started last week. The co-op meets every other week for a total of 6 times in the fall and 6 times in the spring and the kids can sign up for up to 3 hours of classes. The girls enjoyed it, and will hopefully make some friends!<br /><br />My class, Drawing and Painting, was a little intense! There were 15 kids ages 3-8 with paint all talking over one another and over me! I had to abandon most of my lesson plan after the first 5 minutes, and just let them free paint. I do not know how preschool teachers manage! I could have really used a glass of wine and a sensory deprivation room after the whole experience. 5 classes left and I think I have a few good ideas about getting the situation under control from the start next time...it involves snacks.<br /><br />We took the weekend off and had some fun! After my boating lesson we hit the Farmer's Market, and went to the beach.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nXVOGVWw1gA/VBeniHNoZ1I/AAAAAAAAcos/AdJLVGSRXiI/s1600/IMG_1936.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nXVOGVWw1gA/VBeniHNoZ1I/AAAAAAAAcos/AdJLVGSRXiI/s1600/IMG_1936.jpg" height="640" width="480" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-91NlwiRYAeg/VBenb_IxlfI/AAAAAAAAcoc/ORKZrr1QtY0/s1600/IMG_1948.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-91NlwiRYAeg/VBenb_IxlfI/AAAAAAAAcoc/ORKZrr1QtY0/s1600/IMG_1948.jpg" height="516" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v3tdROnMmko/VBeniB6JE4I/AAAAAAAAcow/gi4cgSbxZPY/s1600/IMG_2021.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v3tdROnMmko/VBeniB6JE4I/AAAAAAAAcow/gi4cgSbxZPY/s1600/IMG_2021.jpg" height="640" width="520" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dancing at the Farmer's Market</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3D-AOCa6W34/VBenyWORn-I/AAAAAAAAcpM/-WPlpZr-AZM/s1600/IMG_2032.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3D-AOCa6W34/VBenyWORn-I/AAAAAAAAcpM/-WPlpZr-AZM/s1600/IMG_2032.jpg" height="640" width="480" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">hatched turtle nest</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t--OwMZG4OE/VBentkkxEQI/AAAAAAAAcpE/bzG-mMo_wbA/s1600/IMG_2060.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t--OwMZG4OE/VBentkkxEQI/AAAAAAAAcpE/bzG-mMo_wbA/s1600/IMG_2060.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OqYMphqfsY0/VBen5pzS1eI/AAAAAAAAcpU/WO_jo64rirA/s1600/IMG_2094.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OqYMphqfsY0/VBen5pzS1eI/AAAAAAAAcpU/WO_jo64rirA/s1600/IMG_2094.jpg" height="480" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Sweet Pea gets so excited when Jacob body surfs</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oGgp50Ee8mY/VBen9O3FS3I/AAAAAAAAcpk/c0MhaXQLHHs/s1600/IMG_2118.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oGgp50Ee8mY/VBen9O3FS3I/AAAAAAAAcpk/c0MhaXQLHHs/s1600/IMG_2118.jpg" height="640" width="480" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lDltEfd1Vuc/VBen7vanZpI/AAAAAAAAcpc/D_Gb2Ynb0e4/s1600/IMG_2135.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lDltEfd1Vuc/VBen7vanZpI/AAAAAAAAcpc/D_Gb2Ynb0e4/s1600/IMG_2135.jpg" height="640" width="486" /></a></div><br />
