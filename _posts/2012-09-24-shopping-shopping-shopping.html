I went to the Shopping Extravaganza at the outlet malls in Castle Rock with some friends. It was really fun. The big challenge, with all of the amazing deals, don't buy too much! I had to remind myself that we are in the process of selling everything and I really don't need to add a dozen sweaters to my&nbsp;wardrobe, especially considering we will probably spend most of the 1st year or so in tropical weather.<br /><div><br /></div><div>As we were unpacking Audrey's cute new outfits, Jacob and I were discussing how to pack for our adventure in order to keep both quickly growing kiddos in clothes. Dressing Lorelei has started to get easier as she is now fitting into Audrey's old clothes well, but Audrey always seems to be sizing up, or wearing things out. Do we need to pack 3 or 4 years of sizes for each girl before we leave the states? I know they have clothes in other countries, but how handy will it be to have to buy a new wardrobe while out at sea? I will have to start reading some blogs of cruisers' with kids and looking for the answer.<br /><br />On another note, my friend Emily and I took our girls to Mud Lake last week, and had such a great time! We&nbsp;picnicked&nbsp;and played at the lake. Here are some of the photos I took:<br /><br /><br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6cBdWnuO6DA/UGDYVpQn34I/AAAAAAAAZl4/q8Fl98HVWOY/s1600/P1060768.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6cBdWnuO6DA/UGDYVpQn34I/AAAAAAAAZl4/q8Fl98HVWOY/s320/P1060768.jpg" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Emily launching the little boat she made</td></tr></tbody></table><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L-joTFi5Hsc/UGDYNBM-aKI/AAAAAAAAZlw/m5pjBAhDAXQ/s1600/P1060741.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L-joTFi5Hsc/UGDYNBM-aKI/AAAAAAAAZlw/m5pjBAhDAXQ/s320/P1060741.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Lofihg4iO1M/UGDYi1APX3I/AAAAAAAAZmA/G0n0cURrfgs/s1600/P1060775.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Lofihg4iO1M/UGDYi1APX3I/AAAAAAAAZmA/G0n0cURrfgs/s400/P1060775.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">An unfortunate fall into the lake.
