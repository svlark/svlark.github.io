Call us crazy if you will. &nbsp;We know of <a href="http://www.svlark.com/inspiration.html">some people</a> who won't. &nbsp;Last week, after a really, really bad day (maybe I'll elaborate sometime, or maybe not) we decided: We're taking our girls, and we're going to sail the high seas. &nbsp;We're going to homeschool and see the world. <br /><br />Will it be 5 years until we weigh anchor? &nbsp;Will it be 7? &nbsp;Will it be 3? &nbsp;We don't know. &nbsp;Sooner is better, but it will take as long as it takes. &nbsp;In the meantime, we will be preparing ourselves -- mentally, financially, emotionally, nutritionally, physically.<br /><br />We've been in a bit of a rut lately, but we're really &nbsp;excited to be reaching for something again. &nbsp;The journey is the destination and we're reaching to windward!
