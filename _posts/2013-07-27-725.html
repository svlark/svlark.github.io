Audrey wrapped up Unit 6 in the Singapore Math activity book yesterday and she's been on a kick to try to get her name in all her books.&nbsp; She gets her name in them when she can read them aloud without help.&nbsp; April and Audrey did another handwriting lesson today too.<br /><br />I worked through a little of the choking section in the first aid course.<br /><br /><br />
