I've been looking at some Power Squadron <a href="http://uwf.augusoft.net/index.cfm?method=ClassListing.ClassListingDisplay&amp;int_category_id=4&amp;int_sub_category_id=170">courses</a>&nbsp;and some first aid courses. &nbsp;Morgan's Cloud <a href="http://www.morganscloud.com/2011/05/27/great-first-aid-course-for-offshore-voyagers/">recommends</a>&nbsp;the Red Cross' <a href="http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/en/menuitem.d229a5f06620c6052b1ecfbf43181aa0/?vgnextoid=fd7c0ffc9331d210VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=aea70c45f663b110VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD#Wilderness">remote first aid</a>&nbsp;class. &nbsp;I'm going to look into these further.<br /><br />I'd love to try to rent a little cabin sailer on Lake Dillon for a night or 2 this summer and get the whole gang out there. <a href="http://messingaboutinboats.typepad.com/sailing/2009/08/sailing-on-lake-dillon.html">Messing About in Boats</a>&nbsp;talks about renting a Catalina 22 from the <a href="http://www.townofdillon.com/index.aspx?page=109">Dillon Marina</a>. &nbsp;They only mention rentals up to 4 hours. &nbsp;Maybe that's good enough for our girls' first time...<br /><br />I also started reading The Cost Conscious Cruiser a little <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Aiy97sjxZWcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pardey&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rt06wkEakN&amp;sig=n8R-_Gd9YFfSXxyv1n16bcsG9nU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vqciUJ6RCLLlyAG64oCwBg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pardey&amp;f=false">online</a>. &nbsp;It looks like a really neat book.<br /><br />I've been seeing a lot of people, the Pardeys included, talking about just getting out there in something sea-worthy as quickly and cheaply and with as little frills as possible. &nbsp;I wonder if they're really on to something. &nbsp;No freezer; no watermaker; no generator? &nbsp;Sounds a little nuts, but they certainly have a point that the longer you wait to be able to afford all that stuff, the longer you're putting off freedom from the work-a-day lifestyle you're presumably intending to leave behind.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mahina.com/expbroch.html">This</a> would be awesome.
