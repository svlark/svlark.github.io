April's doing a great job moving stuff on craigslist and I read the first chapter of <u>World Cruising Essentials</u> last night.<br /><br />I'm continuing to experiment with ways of maintaining a backlog of tasks. &nbsp;I'm not really happy with my awesome universal to-do list. &nbsp;We're playing with using Trello to orchestrate our efforts. &nbsp;I'm thinking maybe we need something more GTDish. <br /><br />I really did marry the perfect wife for me didn't I? &nbsp;How many women, moms no less, would be up for this plan, not to mention fully-engaged and excited? &nbsp;I love you, April. &nbsp;Thanks for being my perfect partner-in-audacity.
