We had our third showing in 5 days.&nbsp; This one came with 45 minutes' notice and me at work so the girls made it happen.&nbsp; And oh, by the way, we dropped the price another $13K, to $357K.&nbsp; I honestly can't imagine someone not buying this house at this point.<br><br>Audrey did Unit 6 in the Singapore Math textbook from beginning to end this morning.&nbsp; Tomorrow we'll do the activity book for the unit.&nbsp; She also read aloud all 64 pages of of Amelia Bedelia to me this evening.<br><br>April and I went through lesson 2 on CPR in the first aid class together this evening.&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to the remote first aid class.<br><br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-nvdP09tU8-g/UfCoWx79XgI/AAAAAAAAEio/ZMnLiV2Yuh4/s640/blogger-image-1732927710.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; "><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-nvdP09tU8-g/UfCoWx79XgI/AAAAAAAAEio/ZMnLiV2Yuh4/s640/blogger-image-1732927710.jpg"></a></div>
