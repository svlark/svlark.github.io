With lots of help from Dad we finished reinstalling the through-hulls and seacocks in the head this weekend.&nbsp; He also spied water in the battery compartment, so re-bedded the cockpit hatch for that.&nbsp; We also fired up the galley stove; tested out the AC power by plugging in a power tool and firing it up; played with the battery monitoring equipment; put new batteries in the thermostat for the A/C; flipped over the dinghy to have a look; checked out the 7 expired flares; and brainstormed what to do with the dinette to open up floorspace in the salon.&nbsp; A really nice day all around.
