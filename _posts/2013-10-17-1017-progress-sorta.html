So yeah, now we're all sick and it's snowing just as we are picking the U-haul tomorrow.&nbsp; We're all about to build a lot of character with this move.&nbsp;<br /><br />With the pupils and teachers all sick we pretty much took the day off of school.&nbsp; We did finish the Telemachus chapter in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3hDIbgxgmxAC&amp;dq=black%20ships%20before%20troy&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks">TWO</a>, and Audrey went go to Kinderheart and Fabricate, where all the other kids are all sick already too. <u></u>
