The divers came last week and scrubbed the bottom, the prop and the shaft clean, so we were able to squeeze another 500 rpm out of old Perky. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>We made a run outside on Saturday into some lumpy stuff. &nbsp;It was a blast with everyone all jack-lined and tethered and harnessed in. &nbsp;Glad we choose to go with both wind and tide favorable for the return, as the conditions outside jarred loose a bunch of tank sediment and OP conked out with a high vacuum and a bowl of junk in the Racor shortly after we made it back inside. &nbsp;We whipped out the jib, which we&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">had just the night before bent on, and had an easy sail to the turning basin where we set the Fortress and waited for Tow Boat.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Once the polisher finishes with our fuel tank on Wednesday I'll have the long-awaited opportunity to bleed OP, &nbsp;which odds are, I'll get to do more than once during the upcoming trip.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm working on a way to carry the CQR in the roller and the Fortress on the rail without letting it interact with the jib. &nbsp;Other last minute items are to seal up the leaky spot in the bilge pump hose, change OP's oil, and work out how to lash the dink on deck.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
