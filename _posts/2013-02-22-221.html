We made good progress on emptying some furniture today.  I also paid my dues in tile cleaning.<br /><br />I think we may have seen the error of our ways on the FSBO thing.  You still probably have to pay the buyer's agent their 3%, then the attorney is 1%, then the MLS listing is several hundred dollars, plus whatever other marketing expenses we'd incur. Our prospective agent only charges 2% in the first place, so in the end I think we'd be saving ourselves something like .75%.  So we'll just go for it I think.<br /><br />I finally broke through 237 and got to 236.6 this morning.
