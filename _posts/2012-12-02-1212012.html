<br />We saw Len off today, and I really didn't do much else. &nbsp;I got to hang out with Audrey and Lorelei a lot &nbsp;which was really nice. &nbsp;My big plan for tomorrow is to plan steps for the next couple weeks.<br /><br />I did have a nice surprise from the scale this morning.<br /><br />-19.8 @ 251.4<br />
