OK, so wrapping up on Cabo...<br /><br />I found this next conclusion to be less than satisfactory, but Lin and Larry concluded that the boats that were best able to survive being thrown on the beach were the most expensive ones. &nbsp;I'm not questioning the finding, but looking for the most expensive boat you can find, "pound for pound," as they say, just doesn't seem like a great strategy. &nbsp;In fairness, they go on to to discuss the differences in quality of construction that a higher price tag can buy. &nbsp;Anyway, I take their point, but I'd love to know a more reliable way to identify quality construction other than that the boat is expensive. &nbsp;But I think I know what they'd say to me about Hunters and Bavarias.<br /><br />About crew and boat size, they observed that on boats longer than 37 feet, crews of 4 to six were able to get out, and smaller crews had difficulty. &nbsp;They believe that an important question for crews to answer is whether the crew can handle the ground tackle alone while the helmsperson sails or powers clear.<br /><br />Under the heading of emergency tactics, they discuss using a stern anchor when you know you're going to hit the beach, such that when you do, you hit with the strongest part of the hull; and maneuvering the boat such that the waves won't be crashing into the deck as the boat rests on the beach. <br /><br />
