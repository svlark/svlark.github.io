Our cousins came too with their 3 kids. They have a beautiful house on a private lake, with a sandy beach. We were surrounded by family, and it was awesome. The kids took a paddle boat ride, but couldn't figure out how to steer the boat in, so Audrey got pushed in by her cousins. We all took a pontoon boat ride and&nbsp;ate dinner on the beach and then they made a fire so the kids could make s'mores. Jim and Dani really know how to throw a dinner party!!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QZdXBuplbRI/UEUuS3fq5lI/AAAAAAAAZhs/9gLNxPxNWkQ/s1600/IMG_1010.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EgEIT6cbVD0/UEUuClSbAQI/AAAAAAAAZhM/TZMouy3MidA/s1600/IMG_0989.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EgEIT6cbVD0/UEUuClSbAQI/AAAAAAAAZhM/TZMouy3MidA/s200/IMG_0989.jpg" width="150" /></a><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QZdXBuplbRI/UEUuS3fq5lI/AAAAAAAAZhs/9gLNxPxNWkQ/s400/IMG_1010.JPG" width="400" /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Si2gKxz3n4Y/UEUuQrPOy7I/AAAAAAAAZhk/LBsNrGwreMU/s1600/IMG_1009.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Si2gKxz3n4Y/UEUuQrPOy7I/AAAAAAAAZhk/LBsNrGwreMU/s320/IMG_1009.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lzxsTMJAIbM/UEUuPU0OHXI/AAAAAAAAZhc/wwLUmZ0_1Sw/s1600/IMG_0959.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lzxsTMJAIbM/UEUuPU0OHXI/AAAAAAAAZhc/wwLUmZ0_1Sw/s320/IMG_0959.jpg" width="240" /></a></div>This brings up one of my worries about cruising for several years. No family. We can't just jump in the car and drive 45 minutes to visit our family. One consolation is that most of our family really enjoys traveling, and have a proven track record of visiting us when we are living far away. When we were in Alaska everyone visited us at least once, and some many many times (My grandmother and&nbsp;dad&nbsp;both visited 5 and 6 times respectively in the 3 years we lived there). &nbsp;The other side of the coin is, the main reason we decided to move from Alaska to Colorado was in order to be closer to our family. Now, not only will we be saying good bye to them, but also many good friends.<br /><br />Well, I will quote a line from the <a href="http://www.bumfuzzle.com/">bumfuzzle</a>rs...we will cruise 'for as long as we are happy doing it'. This adventure has no rules.
