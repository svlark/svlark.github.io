Well, this is supposed to be a progress report, but I have no progress to report.&nbsp;<br /><br />We're paralyzed by disorganization and the magnitude of the task before us.&nbsp; We'll continue pushing against our internal obstacles and eventually break through.&nbsp; Hopefully there will be sufficient time remaining at that point to address the things we need to address.<br /><br />Specifically, we are anticipating moving onto a 36-foot boat from a 1200 square foot apartment plus a garage full of stuff.&nbsp; How much of our stuff do we need to dump?&nbsp; About 98%, I'd say.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, maybe we'll get there.&nbsp; Or maybe we'll leave the apartment full of stuff and let it be the someone else's problem.&nbsp; Are we allowed to do that, really?<br /><br />73 days left.
