OK, so we <a href="http://www.svlark.com/2014/06/road-trip-day-1-colorado-to-kansas.html">moved to Florida</a>.<br /><br />This weekend we'll try to get the leaky through-hull replaced with Dad's help in anticipation of launching in a couple weeks.&nbsp; April's research indicates that switching the transom decals should be done with the boat dry, so we need to get Lark's flair all ordered up in a hurry too.
