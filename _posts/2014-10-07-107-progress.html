The glass-work is all done on the tray and stringer supporting the engine. &nbsp;The aft motor mount bracket's bolt holes have been plugged with epoxy and re-drilled. &nbsp;The stabilizing bracket for the forward part of the stringer, fabricated from 1/2-inch aluminum, is installed. &nbsp;The Perkins has had all her rusty spots Osphoed, primed and painted. &nbsp;Darrel, my new favorite diesel guy, will be on Lark Thursday replacing hoses and hose clamps and reinstalling the old girl. &nbsp;Jim the refrigeration guy will be out Thursday to replace the Frigibar.
