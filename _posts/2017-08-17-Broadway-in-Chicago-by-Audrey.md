Grampsy took us down town to see the Broadway show "Aladdin!" We had to wear fancy shoes that hurt our feet. I guess we're not used to wearing real shoes! At the end of the show streamers flew from the stage and all over everyone! It was such a good show, with lots of singing and dancing and even a flying carpet! We took the train back and when we got home it was really late! We got in bed at midnight.
