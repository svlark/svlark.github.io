We played our cool new number-bond card game.&nbsp; It's so fun and effective, I'm considering moving on with the next units in Math before being at 100% on memorizing the bonds, because I no longer have any doubt that we will have them in short order.<br /><br />We also read from <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Cloud_Weavers.html?id=rMx3PQAACAAJ">Cloud Weavers: Ancient Chinese Legends</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kM93eXPpto4C&amp;dq=on%20the%20other%20side%20of%20the%20hill&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks">Little Town in the Ozarks</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BZo7RwPS0MsC&amp;dq=magic%20treehouse%20knight&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks">The Knight at Dawn</a>.<br /><br />Audrey's pretty sick, so we'll probably skip school tomorrow.
