I had a meeting Wednesday morning aboard Lark with Captain Roger the fiberglass whiz and Darrell&nbsp; of Harmon Marine Services in Vero Beach.&nbsp; We've hatched a plan to boost the engine out, reinforce the wobbly stringer with a couple fabricated brackets from the solid stringer, then put old Perky back, having given it a good going over while it was out.&nbsp; That will be in about a week, let's hope.<br /><br />I also got word from Jim of Southern Comfort Marine refrigeration that he can replace our refrigeration unit for $1200 installed.&nbsp; Could be better, but it could be a lot worse I suppose.<br /><br />Dad and I changed the oil in Perkins this morning, which went well.&nbsp; It&nbsp; takes just about five quarts.&nbsp; I got a cool little brass Jabsco pump for pulling the oil out of the sump which worked great.<br /><br />Tomorrow we'll take Lark on the ocean for the first time, weather permitting.&nbsp; The forecast just offshore is for southwest winds 10 to 15 knots and seas 2 to 3 feet.&nbsp; Low tide is at 12:34 which will be favorably both for leaving and returning..
