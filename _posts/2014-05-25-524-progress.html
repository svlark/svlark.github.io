We made an offer and it was accepted on Friday for the Ericson 36C in Ft. Pierce.&nbsp; I don't guess she'll be the boat we take across an ocean, but she'd be a great boat to learn to cruise on and I think we'll have a great time with her.<br /><br />We packed our kitchen box today which was the last of the boxes we hadn't at least started already.&nbsp; Tomorrow we'll move into suitcases and take all the clothes boxes and finish off the book and school boxes, and from there out, anything that's not against the east wall of the garage or in a suitcase upstairs, or in the safe cabinet in the kitchen is dumpster-eligible.&nbsp; Can you feel the freedom of it all?<br /><br />24 days
