All our inspections and appraisals and everything are complete and all our buyer's inspections and appraisals and we are a go. Move out should be on the 19th.&nbsp; Now if only we could motivate to pack.<br /><br />I'm progressing through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1456310038/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">BOS</a>.&nbsp; Cap'n Fatty said that you should sign up for the West Marine catalog, so I did, and that came today.&nbsp; Not that I'm going to start buying $3000 winches or $17000 roller furlers, but just for the educational content.&nbsp; There really are a lot of interesting little sidebars and stuff.
