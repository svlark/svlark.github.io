I've been doing a lot of leak repair. &nbsp;Two of the three main leaks are into bunks, which is simply intolerable. &nbsp;The third is the mast boot which is slightly less immediate of an issue. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I've been agonizing over whether I did the right thing when I spread 5200 over a long crack in the skin of the deck just after a downpour. &nbsp;I had been hoping to do it after a bit of a dry spell, but none had been forthcoming and in the meantime the darn thing gets another soaking 2 or 3 times every day. &nbsp;So I finally just did it. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Did I seal in a bunch of water which will now destroy the rest of the deck coring?</div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Maybe so, but I don't know that there was any better option available to me. &nbsp;Well, we'll see. &nbsp;Maybe it'll be a good DIY project to tear it up and replace the core in couple months if things get a little drier&nbsp;</span></div>
