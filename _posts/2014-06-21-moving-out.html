Moving day was awesome. &nbsp;I took 3 more full carloads of stuff to the dumpsters. <br /><div><br /></div><div>It took two trips to get what was left to the hotel, so clearly we still haven't cut enough. &nbsp;Tomorrow we'll ship 2 more boxes of stuff ahead of us to throw out when we get there. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>No one ever said minimalism is easy.</div><div><br /></div><div>Tomorrow we leave Colorado!</div>
