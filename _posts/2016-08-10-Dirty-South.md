We’re on dirt.  Even poor Lark is on dirt, strapped down at least until the end of September.  It’s been fun to spend some good quality time with Mom and Dad and cousins here in Melbourne.  2 bedrooms and a couple hundred air-conditioned square feet feels decadent.  The locker is tidy and organized.  We’re off to Chicago for a couple months after this.  Then what?  No one knows…
