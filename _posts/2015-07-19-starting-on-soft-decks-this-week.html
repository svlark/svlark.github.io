I'm going to start taking some concrete steps on this soft deck issue shortly. &nbsp;April and the girls will be off of Lark for the next 4 weeks so I'm going to attempt to get the cockpit floor done in that time.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This week I'm going to go have a talk with the experts over at Fiberglass Depot and try to get the cockpit floor clear which will entail taking out the electronics and engine controls and icebox. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Let the fun begin!</div>
