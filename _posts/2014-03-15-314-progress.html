April and I began going through my photographic inventory of the house and garage and identifying the items to keep, to decide about, and to ship to others.&nbsp; Everything else is a strong candidate for the estate seller.&nbsp; It's simultaneously agonizing and exhilarating.<br /><br />We also reviewed Vigor's Cosmo quiz for seaworthy boats from <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LRfo_PZOApkC&amp;q=the+seaworthy+offshore+sailboat&amp;dq=the+seaworthy+offshore+sailboat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_zUxUtzOCZKkqQHr14HYBg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA">TSOS</a>.&nbsp; I need to apply that to all the boats we consider from now on.&nbsp; It scores boats (and crew) with 56 questions on a scale from 60 to 242, where a score of 131 means that you shouldn't even pay for a survey.&nbsp; Lower is better.&nbsp; On the basis of my personal experience, we go into the quiz for any boat with a score of 8.&nbsp; Most of the questions are ones I'll be able to answer for myself by looking at pictures of boats, but several will need answers from the sellers, including:<br /><br />- number of through-hulls?<br />- material of through-hull fittings?<br />- type of seacocks?<br />- signs of leaks at the hull to deck joint?<br />- underwater blisters?<br />- number of built in bulkheads?<br />- visible signs of hogging at the chainplates?<br />- emergency tiller?<br />- soft spots on deck?<br />- leaks at through-deck fastenings?<br />- backing plates for through-deck fastenings?<br />- cockpit self-draining (number, size of drains)?<br />- layup of rigging?<br />- standing rigging material?<br />- rigging terminators?<br />- 2-way toggles at both ends of all rigging?<br />- permanent backstay?<br />- what type of rigging turnbuckles?<br />- going to windward, is there a lee or weather helm, slight or strong, or balanced?<br /><br />I don't envy the seller who gets this homework assignment!<br /><br />96 days.
