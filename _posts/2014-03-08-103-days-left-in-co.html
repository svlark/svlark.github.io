103 days left in CO. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>What in the world will we do with ourselves? &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As a reminder to my future self and to others pursuing similar long range goals, there were always times like this, when we felt like we were spinning our wheels in the face of onrushing obligations and deadlines. &nbsp;So far we have always gotten traction eventually and moved on. &nbsp;It's my expectation that at some point, a few years from now, I will read this in a similar situation, and be able to see it from the perspective of having achieved a worthy goal.</div><div><br></div><div>Things always look better after a good night's rest.</div>
