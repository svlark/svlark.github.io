We've shipped out some furniture that we were storing.&nbsp; We've been reading <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wcaR-diN5osC&amp;dq=the+essential+of+living+aboard&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">The Essential of Living Aboard a Boat</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fgtXO9LyROoC&amp;dq=sell+up+and+sail&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">Sell Up and Sail</a>.&nbsp; We've been working on culling our printed photos and getting the keepers set to digitize.&nbsp; I've been getting boxes of old digital media consolidated onto a single 1.5TB drive and getting rid the old media.&nbsp; This weekend we had a very productive strategy session in the garage working out items to sell, donate, move, and store.&nbsp; I've been learning Spanish with duoLingo. Most exciting: we're going to actually look at some boats and go sailing next month.
