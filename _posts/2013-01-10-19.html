Oh, I'm late for bed, but have good progress to report on several fronts. &nbsp;Audrey did a a great job with the latest lesson in TYCTR this evening. &nbsp;We've read another chapter from <u>South from Alaska</u> and find it not only beautifully written but incredibly motivating and inspiring. &nbsp;I was able to forge ahead in <u>Live on the Margin</u> with a good 75 minutes on the bus today. &nbsp;I also finally cracked open&nbsp;<u>The Homeschooling Book of Answers</u>,&nbsp;which my good Raothbardian pal, Whitney gave us and also found it most encouraging and motivating. &nbsp;And finally, a third good weigh-in in a row this morning. &nbsp;Good night!<br /><br />-24 @ 247.2
