What a&nbsp;<a href="http://eyoni.blogspot.com/p/pictures-of-eyoni.html">fascinating boat</a>. &nbsp;39 feet, aluminum, flat-bottomed with a centerboard. &nbsp;She draws only 3 feet with the board up. &nbsp;You can beach her standing upright for low tide to perform minor maintenance, then sail her away when the tide comes in.
