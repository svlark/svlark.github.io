We had a nice planning meeting for our educational efforts for this fall. &nbsp;Here are the math, science, history, grammar, &nbsp;spelling, and composition curricula we've assembled so far.<div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-a5pE9krc2To/Ub1BEOynccI/AAAAAAAAEeo/Wv6O45ONaE0/s640/blogger-image-1720712294.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-a5pE9krc2To/Ub1BEOynccI/AAAAAAAAEeo/Wv6O45ONaE0/s640/blogger-image-1720712294.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">We've gotten things rolling with reading, handwriting and math and we'll keep that up and gradually add the other stuff once we consolidate our routine with those. &nbsp;We'll get all these balls in the air for fall and be off to the races.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">At our present pace, I'm pretty sure we'll complete the first math book and handwriting book by the end of summer, so well just continue with next books this summer.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">We released our 'flies today. &nbsp;They were great!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">I did some research on working in Oz and NZ, as it seems like a common pattern to sail that far, then stop and work for a bit before continuing. &nbsp;Happily, it looks like software engineers and psychotherapists are on the lists of occupations which are eligible for temporary work visas. &nbsp;I'll continue this line of research and hope to get good advice from a number of cruisers we follow who've done it.</div>
