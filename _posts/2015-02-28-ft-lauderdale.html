I was working on bleeding OPs fuel system and the head of the bleed nut on the governor housing twisted right off. &nbsp;A tiny little fountain of diesel ensued. &nbsp;So today we made the 200 mile round trip to track down a new part on Ft Lauderdale's amazing Marina Mile. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The gas and time were the biggest costs, &nbsp;as the gang at Everglades Diesel Injection wouldn't take a penny for fixing the assembly while I waited.</div><div><br></div><div>That 4-hour round trip take us 4 days aboard Lark in a couple more weeks.</div>
