We've been continuing to work on memorizing.&nbsp; Along with "<a href="http://www.scrapbook.com/poems/doc/22663/351.html">Work</a>" and "<a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/brown-and-furry/">Caterpillar</a>"&nbsp; and we've all been working on "<a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/adventures-of-isabel/">The Adventures of Isabel</a>."&nbsp; We've gotten halfway through.&nbsp; It's got some great words like, "enormous," "ravenous," "cavernous," "rancor," "hideous," "zwieback," and "concocter."<br /><br />We've been starting to get more calls for showings, and we've also reduced our price by $8000.&nbsp; Let's get this place sold!<br /><br />
