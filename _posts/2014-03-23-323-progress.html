We're thinking of 6 possibilities at the moment:<br /><br />- Kim's Passport<br />- the Tanton<br />- the Westerly<br />- NJ Passport<br />- the bunk-bed class C 28 (could be a good way to look at a lot of boats if one of these boats doesn't work out before 6/18)<br />- none of the above<br /><br />And we're resurrecting the Todo tab.<br /><br />We called Mexico about the Westerly today and left a message.<br /><br />I've been corresponding with a surveyor who may look at the Tanton for us.<br /><br />We set up an appointment for tomorrow to discuss her Passport with Kim.<br /><br />We need to get a written slip rent quote and send it along with our insurance quote to Essex.&nbsp; Hopefully we get that sent off tomorrow.<br /><br />We'll get some more information this week on the work situation.<br /><br />86 days left.<br /><br />
