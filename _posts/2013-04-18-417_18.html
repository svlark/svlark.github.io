Audrey finished TYCTR today, and she does indeed know how to read. &nbsp;The challenge for us now is to find material interesting enough to keep her engaged while keeping the vocabulary do-able. &nbsp;She wants to read Anne of Green Gables, but that's got some serious vocabulary. &nbsp;I'm not sure how to proceed on that. &nbsp;I know that she enjoys the story since we've read it twice, and I don't want to limit her, but I don't want to give her something that would be discouragingly difficult. &nbsp;We'll figure it out. <br /><br />We finished <u>South from Alaska</u>. &nbsp;That's a really great inspiring book.<br /><br />I've been really enjoying reading <u>Inspecting the Aging Sailboat</u>.<br /><br />Remind to tell you about the valuable lessons I've been learning about stress, anxiety, and mindset. &nbsp;I'm kinda sleepy now though.<br /><br />226.5
