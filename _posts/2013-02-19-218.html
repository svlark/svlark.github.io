I got the kitchen grout all sealed, the window trim back up, sorta, removed the last of the baby gates, and all the baby locks on the cabinets.<br /><br />I also did some pricing research with some comps. &nbsp;It's really weird the way things are priced right now. &nbsp;Big beautiful houses are cheap; little ones are expensive. &nbsp;Fortunately for us, ours is little. &nbsp;Hopefully things will be better sorted out in a few weeks.<br /><br />Audrey did a great job with lesson 68.<br /><br />239.4
