About the boats.<br /><br />The R44 may be an awesome circumnavigator, in particular considering that she was just circumnavigated.&nbsp; Then again she may be shot, in particular considering that she was just circumnavigated.&nbsp; She has great equipment and excellent tankage -- 210 gallons of water, 125 of fuel.&nbsp; Her number are great.&nbsp; ish.&nbsp; She is a ketch with an amputated mizzen.&nbsp; So what's her real SA/D?&nbsp; I found a bunch of posts by the seller from a couple years back where he described the rig as "crap" and said that he constantly removes rust from the chainplates.&nbsp; And he repairs new blisters every time he hauls her.&nbsp; And the engine has 10,000 hours. <br /><br />Our thinking on the E36 vs. the R44 is that, being a  substantially smaller boat, we'll spend less on her, not only at  purchase, but at every turn; and equally importantly, probably sail her  lots more than we would the R44.&nbsp; And those are the two things we need  most now: to stack bills and build experience on the water.<br /><br />So we made that offer on that Ericson, and the owner doesn't want to  do a sea-trial.&nbsp; What is that about?&nbsp; Strange.&nbsp; I guess it's still  worthwhile to consider her on the basis of a lower price.&nbsp; If we  just assume the worst about the rig and engine and price it that way, I  guess it's fine.&nbsp; I guess it could be a real bargain that way.<br /><br />If we were able to log 2 4-hours cruises per week for 2 years we'd actually know a thing or two by the time we left.&nbsp; Sitting right at Ft. Pierce Inlet as she does, we could actually start to log real sea time too.&nbsp; We'd start to get first-hand experience of dealing with tides and currents, anchoring, sailing, reefing, MOB procedures, fishing, motoring, docking, VHF, and living and cooking aboard.&nbsp; With her sailing dinghy, I can even teach the girls how to sail in the safety of the basin.&nbsp; All around, I'm finally convinced that the E36 is a great boat for us at this point in this adventure at a great price and in a great place.<br /><br />Or we could wait.&nbsp; There's no reason to rush buying a boat.&nbsp; But what should we wait for?&nbsp; Are we going to find a another decent boat that's not in need of significant maintenance in the sub-30 range?&nbsp; Are we going to be able to save more money living ashore than we could on the $5/ft dock in Ft. Pierce?&nbsp; Are we going to be able to make up time learning those hands-on lessons?&nbsp; I'm thinking not.<br /><br />Well, we'll sleep on it and see what we think in the morning.
