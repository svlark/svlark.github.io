Len got that new door fully mounted and installed. &nbsp;There's still finish work to be done with molding and paint and stuff but it's looking very nice. <br /><br />I've lost 19 pounds since starting this project. &nbsp;It's slow but steady progress. &nbsp;Since my all-time high of over 284 pounds, I'm down over 31 pounds. &nbsp;Things will work out a lot better aboard if I can move quickly and easily about the boat. &nbsp;Plus it'll be great if I can &nbsp;avoid a mid-ocean heart attack. &nbsp; So I'll continue to push. &nbsp;I'll be happy if I can make 225, thrilled with 200, and super-duper thrilled with 175.<br /><br />-18.7 @ 252.5<br /><br />
