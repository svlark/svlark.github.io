We all had the flu.  Thus the failure to the blog.  Actually I'm the only one over it at this point.  Poor girls.<br /><br />I got a new functional knob and deadbolt into our new front door and took some chips from the wall to get color-matched at the depot tomorrow.  <br /><br />I started the options chapter in Live on the Margin.  <br /><br />Audrey and I started The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  She did awesome on lesson 53 in TYCTR. <br /><br />Lorelei asked to play word games today and wouldn't stop until lesson 3.  I don't think she's quite up to it just yet, as I have to help her get most of the answers, but she certainly enjoys the ritual.
