We forgot to mention what in the heck happened to all those school posts we used to do.  Did we become unschoolers?  Get lazy?  Well, yeah, maybe a litte of each.  But really we discussed it and decided that these poor kids do deserve a little privacy, so we should stop posting every last detail of everything they do for school.  

We do want to continue to post about our experiences as homeschoolers though and so we'll be doing a bit more of that.
