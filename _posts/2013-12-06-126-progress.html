I saw this article on Hacker News today: <a href="http://jamesclear.com/successful-people-start-before-they-feel-ready">Successful People Start Before They Feel Ready</a>.&nbsp; It's really just a collection of anecdotes about Richard Branson, but I think the author makes a worthwhile point, and it's actually a point that Pat Schulte makes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Live-Margin-Patrick-Schulte-ebook/dp/B00AK5QRNE">Live on the Margin</a>.&nbsp; Pat also says, paraphrasing, that to wait until you're ready, is a perfect recipe to never actually go.&nbsp; So anyway, good reminder today.<br /><br />Undaunted by the risk of overpreparing, however, I did continue to forge ahead in <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Modern_Cruising_Sailboat_A_Complete.html?id=88OrMVCYf5cC">TMCS</a>&nbsp;(The Modern Cruising Sailboat). &nbsp; <br /><br />
