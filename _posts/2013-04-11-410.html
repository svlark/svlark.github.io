So yeah, we had 7 people and 3 dogs at the house today.  Melissa and Keegan mostly finished, though weather ruled out re-staining the deck.  All the new paint looks awesome.  Matt the handyman made good progress, installing the new vanity top downstairs, wall base and overhead lights in the garage, and coat hooks in the mud room.  Tomorrow he'll install tub and sink fixtures and baseboard in the kitchen.<br /><br />April and I have so far gotten (and kept, more importantly), the kitchen, office and upstairs bedroom show-ably clean. Another 8 boxes of stuff and 30 gallons of trash went out the garage.  <br /><br />Audrey read me lessons 94 and 95 today and I had to disappoint her by saying goodnight before she could read me lesson 96.<br /><br />227.3
