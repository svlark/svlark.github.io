I spent 4 hours in our crawl space today filling gaps with that expanding foam stuff. &nbsp;For insulation, yes, but also, unfortunately, for critters. &nbsp;That was one of the more unpleasant experiences of late. &nbsp;So,&nbsp;good progress on getting the house in shape.<br /><br />And on another challenge I've set for myself. &nbsp;I'm not, um, lazy, exactly, but I will take any excuse avoid doing something unpleasant. &nbsp;I'm lazy about doing stuff that doesn't seem like fun. &nbsp;What do you call that? &nbsp;Lazy? &nbsp;Anyway, I realize that this is a big liability and even more so as a cruiser where self-sufficiency counts for a lot and often entails unpleasant jobs. &nbsp;So I'm working on plowing through the impulse to avoid them and do what needs to be done and today was a big victory on that front.<br /><br />April's friend Elsa lent us a copy of her brother-in-law's (Mike Litzow, of <a href="http://thelifegalactic.blogspot.com/">thelifegalactic.blogspot.com</a>) book, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7y4rYAAACAAJ&amp;dq=south+from+alaska&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f2TeL65gmh&amp;sig=m1sYJ_iqBK7Bx3oCprcOeAXwwAA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yfRXUKejAsOe2wXV04GgBA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg">South From Alaska</a>, which I think is only distributed in Australia. &nbsp;We started reading that this afternoon and we're really enjoying it. &nbsp;It's very nicely written, about a very identifiable couple, and very encouraging that this can in fact be done.<br /><br />April made delicious grilled salmon with garlic, lemon and pepper for dinner. &nbsp;I might just become a seafood lover yet.<br /><br />
