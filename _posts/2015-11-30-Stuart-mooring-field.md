We sailed from Indian Harbor Beach to Fort Pierce on Friday and from Fort Pierce to Stuart on Saturday.  We heard from friends aboard fellow kid boat Piper on Friday evening that they were on a mooring ball in the field at Sunset Marina in Stuart and so we decided to go join them.  So far we love it!  The mooring field brings a nice mix of proximity to friends and privacy from neighbors. Pics to follow...
