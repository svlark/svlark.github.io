Audrey did great with lesson 73. &nbsp;Next lesson is regular orthography!<br /><br />We spent some time organizing our task cards and planning for the best ways to use Len's help while he's here for the next 10 days. &nbsp;Hopefully we'll be able to make good progress on replacing the bi-fold doors on the laundry room and upstairs bathroom; adding a little bench and shelves to the mudroom; repairing the busted drawers in the kitchen; putting up the lights in the garage; adding pantry storage; and possibly replacing the flooring in the kitchen and bathrooms.<br /><br />234.9
