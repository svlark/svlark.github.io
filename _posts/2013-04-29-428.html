We had our open house with Lisa today. &nbsp;7 groups came through, which was great.&nbsp; That's 8 showings in 2 days.<br /><br />I've been reading up more on the Valiants and the Robinson Curriculum and a related one called the <a href="http://www.accelerated-achievement.com/" target="_blank">A-2 curriculum</a>, and I've been really getting into video logs of passages like Estrellita's:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iOf4mQ8qBa0" width="420"></iframe></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>I'm really looking forward to watching all the videos from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trJNSVnmWTw&amp;list=PLYi0ZDWfmQxFehJYSqKSBc0tqMCep8Ggb" target="_blank">the passage from Hawaii to Alaska aboard Lealea</a>, an Albin Vega 27. <br /><br />These videos are great for fueling our inspiration. &nbsp;One thing I've learned over the years is that the biggest obstacle to success in a long-term effort is often simply losing interest as the novelty of the idea wears off and an array of a million mundane tasks necessary to realize it comes into focus. &nbsp;So these things are really great.<br /><br />229, for crying out loud.
