Hooray! &nbsp;We finally got our Amazon shipment, including Jimmy Cornell's <u>World Cruising Destinations</u> and <u>World Cruising Essentials</u>.<br /><br />We read the medical preparations chapter from <u>The Capable Cruiser</u>. &nbsp;Lin and Larry recommend not only the Red Cross CPR and Wilderness First-Aid classes but a more intensive multi-day emergency medicine seminar (e.g. Wilderness Medical Associates' "Offshore Emergency Medicine", Dickie L. Hill's "Medicine at Sea") for folks who are contemplating long-term cruising. &nbsp;The seminar will probably run about $1500 for both of us, and the Red Cross class will also be a couple hundred dollars apiece. &nbsp;As shipboard references, they recommend&nbsp;<u>Your Offshore Doctor: A Manual of Medical Self-Sufficiency at Sea</u> and the <u>Merck Manual of Medical Information</u>.<br /><br />For kids' health they say the biggest issues are ear infections and infected coral cuts. &nbsp;For ear infections they recommend a drop of oil in the ears before swimming and alcohol swabs twice a day as preventatives. &nbsp;For cuts, they recommend something called Silvadine.<br /><br />It seems that a number of cruisers are supporting themselves largely by writing online. &nbsp;I think the model is basically write a lot of good content that draws a lot of traffic and make money on the ad revenue. &nbsp;Maybe then you also get a weekly or monthly column in some publication, and you may also get some level of sponsorship by equipment manufacturers too. &nbsp;For that kind of thing, I think the key is great pictures which just so happen to feature some item or other. &nbsp;It probably helps to be photogenic.
