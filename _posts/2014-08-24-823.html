We've been stocking up on live-aboard stuff. April got her set of nesting pans for the galley and a micro-fiber towel we've been eying.&nbsp; It's supposed to be super absorbent and fast-drying, so we'll give it a try and if works out, order several more.&nbsp; We picked up a drinking-water hose and I got a set of the coolest little ratcheting wrenches with "<span itemprop="description">chamfered lead-ins" which I can't wait to try out on my rebuilt raw water pump.</span><br /><span itemprop="description"><br /></span><span itemprop="description">Tomorrow morning I'm getting some lessons in maintenance procedures for the Perkins with my man Tim from Florida Marine Diesel.&nbsp; Afterward the girls and I will hopefully make some headway on our exploding to-do-aboard list and splash around at the pool at the marina a little.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span itemprop="description"><br /></span><span itemprop="description">We're going to see about getting the dinghy down off Lark's roof.&nbsp; Audrey's been dying to take it out for a spin, so we'll try.&nbsp; Maybe we'll be able to strap it onto the Nissan's roof rack and bring it over to Jaycee Park.</span><br /><br /><span itemprop="description">I keep discovering new compartments aboard Lark with neat things in them.&nbsp; Today I found three new compartment in the V-berth containing spare parts for the Perkins, 2 more sails, a big old anchor, and some canvas in nice shape which I think goes on the cockpit structure.</span>
