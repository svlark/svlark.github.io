I got that smelly propane connection fixed and in the process completed my first 12v maintenance task. &nbsp;First of many no doubt. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I was going to try to replace my frayed outhaul, which runs inside the boom. &nbsp;I had this great idea to take the new line, stitch it end-to-end to the old line then pull the old line out, thereby pulling the new line through. &nbsp;Everything went fine until I went to pull the old one out and discovered the line I was pulling was not the line I had just itched the new one to. but a line that is somehow shackled to that line inside the boom. &nbsp;I have no idea how to get at it in there. &nbsp;So for now I'lleave the old outhaul but I've cut off the fraying part so it'll just be kinda short.</div><div><br></div><div>April did a beautiful job patching our cockpit canvas. &nbsp;It looks really nice.</div>
