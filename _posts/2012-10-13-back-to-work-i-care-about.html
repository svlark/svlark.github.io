Alright, we got through that audit at work. &nbsp;I think. &nbsp;So now I get to get back to working on things I care about. &nbsp;Like the windows and door project, which I really only care about as a means to selling the house, which I only care about as a means to buying a boat and sailing away. &nbsp;I guess for that matter working at work is only one step further removed from what I actually care about than the windows and door project. &nbsp;But anyway, I think I'm finally ready to do some filling and hardening, hopefully to be following shortly by some priming and painting.<br /><br />-9.0
