<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I was recently reading an article about people's <a href="http://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2011/05/31/the-top-5-regrets-people-make-on-their-deathbeds">biggest regrets in life</a>,&nbsp;and realized that we are absolutely doing the right thing! One part of the article that especially spoke to me was</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="background-color: white;">I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me…</span><i>When people realize that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it, it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled. Most people have had not honored even a half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices they had made, or not made". &nbsp;</i></span></blockquote><div style="font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 17px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Jacob and I discussed sailing the world (he has always loved sailing) on our 1st date. It has always been a dream<span class="Apple-style-span">.</span> <span style="background-color: white;">It is unconventional, and scary, and most likely going to be expensive, but I can not imagine regretting it. I want to spend my best years with my family, seeing the world.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div style="font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 14px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When Jacob and I moved to Alaska, it was also scary and expensive, but it turned into a wonderful adventure. An adventure that brought us closer together. I'm excited to have adventures like that again!&nbsp;</span></div>
