I've struggled to find a spare moment to write, and I'm stealing these moments from sleep, but I'm committed to being accountable to the blog on our progress so here I am. &nbsp;We actually have solid progress and significant developments to report.<br /><div><ol><li>I have finally gotten to work on scraping, sanding, and repainting the windows. &nbsp;It's pretty fun when you just make yourself do it. &nbsp;And I got a new Dremel Multi-Watchamacallit for sanding in the corners. &nbsp;From some other cruising blogs I've read, it's a good tool to have aboard too.</li><li>I fixed that darn leaky faucet.</li><li>We sold some more stuff. &nbsp;We had gotten these Adirondack chairs at Ace like 3 years ago for 20 bucks apiece, and sold the pair for $65. April's a genius of online marketing.</li><li>We received <u>World Cruising Routes</u>, which is really cool.</li><li>We have been in contact with a couple realtors and are meeting with one on Saturday to discuss strategy. &nbsp;It kind of blows my mind, and frankly gives me pause, to think that we could conceivably sell before ski season. &nbsp;We'll just keep putting one foot in front of the other and keep all options open for now. &nbsp;One thing that worries me about waiting for spring is the fiscal cliff. &nbsp;Mind you, I'm certain that it would be good for the economy, but I think it could crater the real estate market again for a couple years.</li><li>My awesome Misesian&nbsp;an-cap&nbsp;pals, Matt and Whitney,&nbsp;(Boulder-based if you can believe it) who home-schooled their two girls for years, have offered to give us a big brain- and material-dump.</li><li>We read the chapters on the milk run and atoll cruising in <u>The Capable Cruiser</u>. &nbsp;Notes to follow someday soon.</li><li>An old friend of April's put us in touch with a friend of his who's a couple years ahead of us on this path. &nbsp;We look forward to picking Bryan's brain.</li></ol><div>Blue Water Sailing School's <a href="http://bwss.com/offshore-passagemaking.html">Offshore Passagemaking</a> class looks really cool. &nbsp;If nothing else, I'm definitely getting all the books on their&nbsp;<a href="http://bwss.com/offshore-reading-list.html">reading list</a>.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Dad also pointed out Melbourne-based <a href="http://ssca.org/">Seven Seas Cruising Association</a>. &nbsp;That looks really cool. &nbsp;I'm looking for ward to taking some of their classes and webinars sometime soon.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yachtworld.com/core/listing/boatMergedDetails.jsp?boat_id=2382067&amp;checked_boats=2382067&amp;ybw=&amp;units=Feet&amp;currency=USD&amp;access=Public&amp;listing_id=64991&amp;url=&amp;imc=pg-fs">beautiful boat</a>.</div>
