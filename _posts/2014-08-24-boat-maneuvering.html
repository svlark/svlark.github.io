It is a nice first step, as the tug has a similar engine and controls, but it is smaller and lighter. Baby steps. Today Captain Jack told me to stop staring at the pilings I didn't want to hit and watch the dock I was trying to line up with. It instantly clicked. It is advice that is ingrained in me from skiing. Look at the space between the trees!<br /><br /></div><div class="p1"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jpZmKzh5UpU/U_qbLS_HV-I/AAAAAAAAcWg/8ek1kSmKm60/s1600/DSC04505.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jpZmKzh5UpU/U_qbLS_HV-I/AAAAAAAAcWg/8ek1kSmKm60/s1600/DSC04505.jpg" height="436" width="640" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YFF44jPCANA/U_qbPEbCvCI/AAAAAAAAcWo/endI9B6uMhM/s1600/DSC04511.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YFF44jPCANA/U_qbPEbCvCI/AAAAAAAAcWo/endI9B6uMhM/s1600/DSC04511.jpg" height="444" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Me, driving the boat.&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JllDwQeb1W4/U_qbB03kF-I/AAAAAAAAcWY/cwZOJNWI1xs/s1600/DSC04533.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JllDwQeb1W4/U_qbB03kF-I/AAAAAAAAcWY/cwZOJNWI1xs/s1600/DSC04533.jpg" height="470" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yJJLoDTLjGI/U_qbQdwp_II/AAAAAAAAcWs/QM94fw31vzQ/s1600/IMG_1095.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yJJLoDTLjGI/U_qbQdwp_II/AAAAAAAAcWs/QM94fw31vzQ/s1600/IMG_1095.jpg" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LO2Sbf2SGpA/U_qbU7AI3HI/AAAAAAAAcW4/R5sCKvmgkb0/s1600/IMG_1106.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LO2Sbf2SGpA/U_qbU7AI3HI/AAAAAAAAcW4/R5sCKvmgkb0/s1600/IMG_1106.jpg" height="480" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">tooting the horn under the bridge</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IiL8mPVMYE4/U_qbg6c2I3I/AAAAAAAAcXI/U_o0_blNxVE/s1600/IMG_1110.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IiL8mPVMYE4/U_qbg6c2I3I/AAAAAAAAcXI/U_o0_blNxVE/s1600/IMG_1110.jpg" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rB0uur1oSBY/U_qbggism4I/AAAAAAAAcXE/sdOGPEtiDoc/s1600/IMG_1132.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rB0uur1oSBY/U_qbggism4I/AAAAAAAAcXE/sdOGPEtiDoc/s1600/IMG_1132.jpg" height="480" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">catching bouys&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>Before I had tried it, I wondered what was so tricky about driving a large sailboat. &nbsp;After all, I learned to drive in my dad's construction van. &nbsp;Talk about handling like a barge! But the boat really doesn't drive like a car! It is rear steering, so the front of the boat doesn't really go where you turn the wheel, especially when it is not going fast. There is also this thing called prop-walk, which makes the boat back up in a clockwise circle, not a straight line. Very tricky!<br /><br /></div><div class="p2">In the meantime we have 3 weekends left until we move aboard, and SO SO much still to do. I’m trying to decide if everyone needs a new mattress in addition to new sheets. It looks like Jacob and my mattress has had quite a bit of water damage in the past, and I’m afraid of the mold that might be living in there!</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p2">My new pots and pans arrived and I am in love with them. They were recommended by Carolyn at the <a href="http://theboatgalley.com/pots-pans-boat/">TheBoatGalley.com</a>, and are the best quality that I have ever owned. Also, they nest so they only take up a half a cubic foot space! &nbsp;The handles come off but in a not flimsy way. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xBvErNSdm_8/U_qY0HSJUbI/AAAAAAAAcWM/uUSvlvCWtfA/s640/blogger-image--1382960593.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xBvErNSdm_8/U_qY0HSJUbI/AAAAAAAAcWM/uUSvlvCWtfA/s640/blogger-image--1382960593.jpg" /></a></div>I also ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B3T5W6Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">a sample towel</a> that I was considering for the boat, and it seems very nice. Jacob used it after his shower tonight and said it was great. It is a nice version of camping towels that feel fluffy, but are super absorbent and dry really quickly, supposedly with out a dryer. I think we will be ordering the rest of the set now. I'm thinking each person will get their own color.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p2">Jacob and I still have a list of things that we need to tackle before we move aboard. Now we are just trying to prioritize and decide what we have to handle immediately.&nbsp;</div><ol class="ol1"><li class="li2">Leaky port above our bed</li><li class="li2">Fix broken Refrigeration</li><li class="li2">Attach blower tube so we can use the stove</li><li class="li2">Put up lifeline netting</li><li class="li2">Outfit the boat: sheets and blankets, dishes and silverware.&nbsp;</li><li class="li2">Shock the water system…if we can ever find the water tank.&nbsp;</li><li class="li2">Fix the leaky fuel tank</li><li class="li2">Finish engine repairs including mounting it</li></ol><br />
