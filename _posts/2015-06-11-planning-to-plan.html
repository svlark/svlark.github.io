We're shooting for a crossing to the Bahamas around Thanksgiving. &nbsp;We have a lot to do first, including some deck repairs and a lot of education and experience building. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>We'll also need to first survive hurricane season so my first priority is to get written down a bunch of things I've had floating around my in my head about that, and to get everything bought and prepared that we won't have time to do if we should find a storm aiming at us. &nbsp;Dear blog, I intend to be accountable to you for this. &nbsp;</div>
