Audrey wanted to do lessons 38, 49, and 40 tonight.  It was really awesome to watch.  I believe we are past a tipping point now and she'll be reading her own books in a matter of a couple months.  It's great not only because, I mean, she can read, but also because I can teach.  That's going to be important as we cruise.  <br /><br />This evening we were reading about Guatemala in World Cruising Destinations.  Rio Dulce sounds like a really neat place.  It winds through the tropical rainforest far inland to a big lake -- Izabal -- and is lined with little indigenous Mayan communities. And the no visa thing is great, of course.<br /><br />I put a big dent in one of our last remaining serious messes-- the upstairs shelving.  Very satisfying to get that cleaned up.  <br /><br />I threw out a pair of 44 pants and pulled out a bunch of barely-used 40s Len had given me from a client of his who'd lost a lot of weight.  I'm really excited to be able to fit into those.  It's been quite awhile since I could wear 40s...<br /><br />-22.4 @ 248.8
