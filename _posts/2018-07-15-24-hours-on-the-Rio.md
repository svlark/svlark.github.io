I thought I could get away with leaving this knife out overnight to wash in the morning.

This cacterpillar had no sympathy for me.

I think Lark's really starting to look great, don't you?

I'm glad they got rid of that pesky wheel.  Now we can finally get some use out of the emergency tiller!

A trip into town on public transit requires some athletic prowess.

I didn't realize until I stepped into this place how badly I needed 50 pounds of sunflower seeds.

But I had been giving some thought to a new dinghy painter, and for some reason they kept it on the same aisle.

Yes, we are in Guatemala.

Welcome to the despensa.

Lark is right down the block.

I stopped for dinner at Sun Dog's Pizza, but this guy seemed to think it should be called something else.

I swear, the dog untied your dinghy!

The fellas from the Chimichanga came for pizza too.

And then the nightly monsoon arrived.  It's a good way to make a simple lancha ride a little more exciting.

I went over to Tijax to see the game this morning.  
![jungle path](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/42743919-94601896-8885-11e8-81fb-1c3e4fd21a22.jpeg)

I saw two good things and four bad things happen.

A momma frog was pretty happy with the outcome.

The guys who work on Lark come in this cayuco.

The time had finally come for a new painter.

Now I don't even have to row.
