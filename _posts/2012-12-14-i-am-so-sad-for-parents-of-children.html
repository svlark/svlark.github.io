<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I am so sad for the parents of the children killed in&nbsp;Connecticut&nbsp;this morning! I can't even imagine the heartache. More proof of the fact that terrible things can happen anywhere, anytime.&nbsp;</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I have had a few people really worried that our sailing adventure will not be safe, and have even told me they think we will not come back alive. I have tried to mention bad things can happen anywhere, and that we will try to be as prepared as possible. At times I have worried myself that it could be dangerous, and of course I would never want to endanger my children. Now, more then ever, I am convinced that we should be living life to the fullest while we can.&nbsp;</span></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_z_N3b49X54/UMu6ZW5J2YI/AAAAAAAAZ0M/NEljxE_6kog/s1600/photo+(4).JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_z_N3b49X54/UMu6ZW5J2YI/AAAAAAAAZ0M/NEljxE_6kog/s640/photo+(4).JPG" width="480" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">my babies enjoying life</td></tr></tbody></table>
