So we got the outboard into the dink finally and drove her around a little. &nbsp;Now of course we need to get over to the DMV and take care of that end of it. &nbsp;I revved the outboard up to full throttle just for about 30 seconds as part of the breaking in schedule and it sure was fun when we started planing.
