Today I replaced all the old smoke detectors with fancy combination smoke and CO detectors. &nbsp;Apparently that's mandatory when you sell a house in CO these days. &nbsp;That's right, you can't sell a house in carbon monoxide without Colorado detectors. <br /><br />Len replaced one of our ancient kitchen light fixtures with a nice new one. &nbsp;It's great except it's one of those stupid CF-only fixtures. &nbsp;I didn't realize they were actually changing the fixtures themselves. I thought I'd be able to stockpile incandescents in order to avoid having a house full of those damn little mercury capsules, but apparently not. &nbsp;Anyway, the new fixture looks much better than the old one.<br /><br />We also replaced the mangy 28-year-old stove hood with a fancy new LG OTR microwave to match the stove. &nbsp; It's pretty sweet.<br /><br />The house is so much more live-able these last couple days than it's ever been with so much junk cleared out and so many previously unaddressed projects completed. &nbsp;It's great! &nbsp;If only it had a full keel and a cutter rig...<br /><br />OK about the showing. &nbsp;The folks were pretty impressed with the location and definitely liked certain parts of the place. &nbsp;Overall they maintained pretty good poker faces, so who knows. &nbsp;I guess the thing is that if you're being shown the place by the seller what else would you do but keep a poker face?<br /><br />We're on chapter 8 of <u>It's Your Boat Too</u>, and I'm in high school in the School of Pipsology.<br /><br /><br />
