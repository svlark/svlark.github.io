We freaked out today to find water running across the floor outside the head. &nbsp;My first thought was that one of the though-hulls in the head was leaking, &nbsp;but turning both off made no difference. &nbsp;My next thought, though I don't know why, was to put the slurping tube of my oil change pump down the shower drain and start pumping. &nbsp;I did that and got some horrible putrid stuff out of the shower sump. &nbsp;At that point the water stopped running across the floor, so I felt better.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Next question: &nbsp;Why had that just started to happen? &nbsp;Where did that water come from? &nbsp;Well, I had just been pouring hot water into our hole-in-the-counter fridge to melt out some ice from the bottom. &nbsp;Could that be it? &nbsp;Another gallon into the hole started water flowing across the floor again, so yes.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Would I have to hand pump the sump every week or so from here out, I wondered? &nbsp;There's a switch in the head marked "shower sump", but it never seemed to do anything. &nbsp; April, maybe try hitting the breaker marked "spare?" &nbsp;Sure enough, it works! &nbsp;So no I don't have to hand pump the sump, but yes it would be a good idea to run the thing periodically. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Another boat-ownership lesson learned the hard way. Or at least the scary, gross, and ultimately hilarious way.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div><br></div>
