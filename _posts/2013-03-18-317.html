We spent 4 hours in the garage purging.  Man, does that feel good.  Some of it was a little emotional too, but it sure feels nice to have it done.<br /><br />Audrey did very well with lesson 79.  20 more lessons to go!  Next I think we'll try some number games.  We have these nice little Kumon books for that.<br /><br />234.1
