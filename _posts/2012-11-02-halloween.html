Whew! Halloween is over! It was&nbsp;incredibly&nbsp;fun-filled and jam-packed. We did a Halloween story-time at the library, a friends party, a cool wonder walk where we met mermaids and princesses, and then last night we trick-or-treated around Nederland. The girls loved all the activities we did, and I loved watching them have so much fun, but I am exhausted!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QtD5yGTK1D8/UJNR6es_nyI/AAAAAAAAZpQ/whpKCOQEKio/s1600/P1060903.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QtD5yGTK1D8/UJNR6es_nyI/AAAAAAAAZpQ/whpKCOQEKio/s400/P1060903.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RVfalwX9Ymw/UJNReOKEW_I/AAAAAAAAZo0/FuN_HmBVqKw/s1600/IMG_4190.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RVfalwX9Ymw/UJNReOKEW_I/AAAAAAAAZo0/FuN_HmBVqKw/s400/IMG_4190.jpg" width="300" /></a>I was reading <a href="http://sv-totem.blogspot.com/">Totem's</a> blog about their Halloween festivities while cruising Papua New Guinea. It was pretty fun to see how similar and how completely different their experience was. They still dressed up, and seemed to have lots of fun creating their costumes. They happen to be cruising with some other families with kids (9 in total) and so they all got to trick or treat together. I'm not exactly sure what that entailed. I hope that as we are cruising we run into other families too, like those guys!<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yJGwhpfbkDI/UJNRkKGwc6I/AAAAAAAAZo8/cDDFAgUYi2M/s1600/IMG_4335.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yJGwhpfbkDI/UJNRkKGwc6I/AAAAAAAAZo8/cDDFAgUYi2M/s400/IMG_4335.jpg" width="305" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-om0GO_EJKAY/UJNRtdSuGgI/AAAAAAAAZpI/lXnoUAYlt3o/s1600/IMG_4374.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-om0GO_EJKAY/UJNRtdSuGgI/AAAAAAAAZpI/lXnoUAYlt3o/s400/IMG_4374.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />The fun doesn't stop around here -- next weekend is Lorelei's birthday party! I'm getting ready to decorate a cake for the first time. Stay tuned for pictures.
