Someone responded to our Zillow 'make me move' ad, and now the most dreaded part of this whole process, getting the house ready to show, is upon us. They want to look at the house this weekend, leaving us a whopping 48 to 72 hours to get it ready. We are frantically cleaning, and making shopping lists. Unfortunately we won't be able to get to some of the bigger projects like re-tiling the bathroom. Jacob and I really do work well under pressure though so I believe in us that we will get it done in time.<br /><br />It's sort of exciting that we may be able to move on to our next adventure sooner rather than later. If this doesn't pan out though at least this exercise is helping us get the house ready more quickly.
