I've been really getting into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AK5QRNE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00AK5QRNE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bumfuzzle-20">Live on the the Margin</a>, which just came out from Pat Schulte (<a href="http://www.bumfuzzle.com/">s/v Bumfuzzle</a>) and Nick O'Kelly.  It's primarily a book about leverage and technical analysis, which is why I wanted to read it.  What I hadn't expected was all the other great content in the first several chapters.  Pat and Nick spend some time talking about why this lifestyle is a reasonable choice and not mere indulgence.  Their analysis of financial, economic, and political dynamics actually verges on praxeological.  Good stuff!<br /><br />-22.8 @ 248.6
