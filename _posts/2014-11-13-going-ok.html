Everything is going OK. <br /><br />Nothing about living aboard is as hard as I'd imagined it would be. <br /><br />The boat needs more maintenance than I'd thought it would.<br /><br />We need a lot more dinghy than we've got in order to actually go anywhere. <br /><br />We went outside the inlet last Sunday and it was the most exciting ride I've ever had in a boat. &nbsp;Large standing and breaking waves in all different directions. &nbsp;Looking up at the bow one moment and then ducking from the spray it makes coming back down the next. <br /><br />Good times!
