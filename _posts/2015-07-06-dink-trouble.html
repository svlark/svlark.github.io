Apparently these foldable dinghies aren't really intended to be towed 400 miles. &nbsp;The floor of our West Marine Hypalon AL-290 has begun to peel back at the bow:<div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NMKSfhr8sQU/VZs6GjdUC8I/AAAAAAAAFoo/Hn_GQti2oy0/s640/blogger-image-106206414.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NMKSfhr8sQU/VZs6GjdUC8I/AAAAAAAAFoo/Hn_GQti2oy0/s640/blogger-image-106206414.jpg"></a></div><br></div><div>We're going to take it for we expect will be a warranty repair, but West Marine won't look at it in the store. &nbsp;Instead they require us to take it to a service center in Stuart and the service center charges $50 to look at it even if it ends up being covered by the warranty. &nbsp;So we're not overly impressed with West on this one.</div>
