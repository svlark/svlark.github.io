28 minutes until our twice-extended inspection objection deadline passes.&nbsp; At this point it's basically insignificant since we've already executed resolution to the objections, but I'll still feel better when it's passed.<br /><br />What to do with ourselves now?&nbsp; The moment is not really right to move to the coast.&nbsp; That will probably be in spring.&nbsp; We'd love to get ourselves a gracefully aging (read <i>cheap)</i> RV to bridge the gap until we find our boat.&nbsp; But what about winter in Colorado?&nbsp; Where can we park ourselves, and how do we not freeze?<br /><br />We'll continue trying to figure it all out...<br /><br />April and the girls kicked butt for our first full school week.&nbsp; We  decided to go ahead and throw Rosetta Stone Spanish into the mix, because math,  biology, history, handwriting, spelling, grammar, composition, and  ancient literature just isn't a sufficient course-load for a  kindergartener.&nbsp; <br /><br />
