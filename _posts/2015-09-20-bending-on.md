I made another payment on our self-insurance premiums yesterday.  The first part of this payment was a couple weeks ago when Erika threatened and I took all the sails down.  The second part was putting them back up.  It's not hard, but surprisingly time-consuming.

First came the staysail:

Then the jib:

I was disturbed when I took them down to see I'd forgotton to wire the shackle at the head of the jib, but it's definitely there this time:

All furled up and ready to fly:
