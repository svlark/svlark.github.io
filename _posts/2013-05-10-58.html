We have another showing tomorrow.&nbsp; One of these times...<br /><br />I've been reading up on math curricula and the math wars.&nbsp; Singapore Math really appeals to me in that it uses direct instruction of basic math facts and continually builds.&nbsp; It's presented in a colorful, engaging format which I think Audrey will enjoy.&nbsp; I also looked into Saxon Math and Math-U-See.&nbsp; We'll definitely need to do more research on these.<br /><br />227
