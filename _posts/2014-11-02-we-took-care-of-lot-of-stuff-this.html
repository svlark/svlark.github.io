We took care of a lot of stuff this weekend.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>On Saturday we gave Lark a good cleaning belowdecks and finally finished unpacking the Nissan from moving off of dirt a couple weeks back.</div><div><br></div><div>Today we got the beautiful new Magma grill installed; repaired the door to the girls' cabin, which had been coming unglued; and did Cap'n Jack's suggested stopgap repair for the deck crack of drilling small holes at each end of the crack and the epoxying the thing for its length. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, I removed the old cowling vent bases to make room for the new ones we ordered. &nbsp;I was dismayed to find that each was installed in a hole cut through the deck without even attempting to seal the core. &nbsp;Well, for what it was worth I went ahead and sealed it myself.</div><div><br></div><div>So a good boat weekend even if the howling winds and plummeting temperatures did keep us tied securely to the dock.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
