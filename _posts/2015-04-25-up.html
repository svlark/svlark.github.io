I went up the mast to replace the main and jib halyards two Saturday's ago but failed. &nbsp;It was pretty scary being up there and April was having lots of problems with overrides on the winches. &nbsp;When I get up there I couldn't figure out how to get the new halyards led through the blocks at the top, but I think that's just because I was too scared to think straight.<div><br></div><div>I got back up there on Sunday. I had Len tension my lines over a cleats. &nbsp;There were no overrides at all which made it go a lot faster. &nbsp;I'm sure glad he didn't accidentally let go. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LSco0igNNik/VUi7Yapc9tI/AAAAAAAAFfI/rzzcuFp4s0k/s640/blogger-image-1108110275.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LSco0igNNik/VUi7Yapc9tI/AAAAAAAAFfI/rzzcuFp4s0k/s640/blogger-image-1108110275.jpg"></a></div><br></div>
