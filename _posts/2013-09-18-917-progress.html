OK, OK, back to the routine. &nbsp;I always seem to lose the rhythm when we have guests. &nbsp;Anyway, I can't put down TSOS. &nbsp;It's a page turner. &nbsp;I've learned lots about anchors and windvanes and steering with the rig, and cooking fuel and heads and stuff like that. &nbsp;Great stuff!<br /><br />With all the canyons being closed due to floods, as well as Audrey's homeschool supplemental program down in Boulder, and our sitter for the Tuesday and Thursday sessions having been traumatized by having had to evacuate her house, remote first aid is not happening this week. &nbsp;We'll have to sign up for the next session.
