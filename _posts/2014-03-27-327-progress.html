So the work situation is solved for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; Hurray!&nbsp; That's a big load off.<br /><br />We're in such a bizarre state of limbo now.&nbsp; With 82 days left on our lease, not only do we not know where we'll live next, we don't even know which coast we'll live on.&nbsp; I'm not complaining, but it's really very strange.&nbsp; It's definitely much less stressful having the job situation resolved for now, though. <br /><br />We're very seriously considering a salty little cutter. Very salty.&nbsp; And little.&nbsp; And we could plausibly be feeding the swimming pigs in months, not years.&nbsp;
