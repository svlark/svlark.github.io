So we have survived about 36 hours as a family of 4 with a big dog on 36 feet, with our sanity intact and showing signs of improvement.&nbsp; We have a million things to do but we're focused for the moment on just learning how to live together in this space.&nbsp; Both cars are stuffed to the gills and our storage locker is full.&nbsp; This from the family who has cut 90% by volume 3 or 4 times in the past 2 years.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sweet Pea is the least amused of us all.&nbsp; She doesn't care for the companionway or boarding.&nbsp; I think her hips are bothering her.&nbsp; We don't have any very good ideas for how to make this work for her at the moment, but we are going to give ourselves some time to figure it out.<br /><br />The engine mount fix appears to have worked.&nbsp; $2800 and 2 weeks after pulling it out, the Perkins is reinstalled and fully reconnected and everything appears to run much more smoothly.&nbsp; Time and use will tell if the fix was sufficient for the long term.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qruScX-2LzY/VEMLoVksbdI/AAAAAAAAc-0/oBoOZ_WSKyQ/s1600/DSC04662.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qruScX-2LzY/VEMLoVksbdI/AAAAAAAAc-0/oBoOZ_WSKyQ/s1600/DSC04662.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Our new waterfront view.</td></tr></tbody></table>
