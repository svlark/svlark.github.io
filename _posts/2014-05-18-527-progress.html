We made a list of 20 or so items that we're still going to try to get sold before we go and spent the day getting those items cleaned up and photographed to list online.&nbsp; Tomorrow we'll try to complete the book, homeschool, and game boxes.&nbsp; They're all started so shouldn't be too bad to finish up.<br /><br />I'm starting to look into dinghy-towing the Jeep with the Nissan.&nbsp; It's more complicated than I'd expected.&nbsp; Maybe I'll have to use a dolly trailer instead.
