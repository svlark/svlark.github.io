You know what we need?&nbsp; We need a hundred-day plan.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here it is:<br /><br />- figure out how to continue paying for this project<br />- figure out where we can go do that where there are lots of boats<br />- get rid of nearly everything<br />- pack what's left<br />- go to the aforementioned place<br /><br />Simple, really.<br /><br />101 days left.
