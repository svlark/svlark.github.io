We read a little for our remote first aid class. <br /><div><br /></div><div>I did a bit of research on classes for USCG Captains' licensing, which could lead to an income steam from deliveries and charters.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We've also been researching Rosetta Stone language courses for the girls and ourselves. &nbsp;It's a really cool program, and of course Audrey's at her prime age for learning languages. &nbsp;I'm thinking we might just have to do it.</div>
