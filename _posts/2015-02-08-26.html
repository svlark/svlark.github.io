I put the FL numbers on the dink and finally put the right propane line thread seal on to that leaky connection.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">I was able to figure out which one of the several connections there was leaking because with the LPG control switched off there was no smell at all and with it switched on there was. All but one of those connections is upstream of that control, therefore&nbsp;</span><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">the downstream one</span><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;was the culprit. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">We're defrosting the plate on the frigibar tonight. Hopefully the ice will be all melted by morning.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">One bummer-- the propane cylinders that came with Lark are apparently under recall, and the company that made them is gone. &nbsp;So I guess we're in the market for new cylinders.</span></div>
