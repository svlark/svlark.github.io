Audrey read her longest story yet tonight. That was Lesson 43.  I'm looking forward to Lesson 50, when we'll lose all the Morse code and cocodrilos...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9aZ2FDx8Fw8/UNvgfZpeczI/AAAAAAAAEIw/BuADps9tNq8/s640/blogger-image--2127782201.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9aZ2FDx8Fw8/UNvgfZpeczI/AAAAAAAAEIw/BuADps9tNq8/s640/blogger-image--2127782201.jpg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">April had an inspiring chat with a friend the other day about FSBO, so we're going to give that a good try. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Mom and Dad sent us a bunch of great boating books for Christmas: <u>Inspecting the Aging Sailboat</u>, <u>Sailing Fundamentals</u>, <u>Adventure on the High Seas</u>, and&nbsp;<u>Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Started Sailing</u>. &nbsp;Oh, and &nbsp;of course, Scuppers,&nbsp;<u>The Sailor Dog</u>. &nbsp;We've been enjoying them all. &nbsp;In fact we're almost already done with <u>Adventure</u>, which is the true story of a family who spent a year cruising from England to Maine, via Spain, Portugal, the Canaries, Gambia, the Windward Islands and Lesser Antilles, and Bermuda. &nbsp;We've read the whole thing aloud to the girls, who've been eating it up. &nbsp;Also, <u>Genius Denied</u>, which looks like it will be inspiring in our educational efforts with the girls. &nbsp;Thanks guys!</div>
