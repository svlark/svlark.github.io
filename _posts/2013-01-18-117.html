I got in another hour of Live on the Margin today.  I decided to go back and re-read some of the material on fade trading to make sure I'm really getting it.  Pretty sure I've got it locked in at this point.<br /><br />The strategy (from memory) is to watch for a stock you know well to touch its 3rd Bollinger Band (3 standard deviations from the 20-day SMA) as traders overreact to some news item, then form a closed one-hour candle between the 1st and 2nd BBs.  You place a limit order at the closing price for that candle with a stop at the swing low, then wait for the price to cross the 20 SMA.  Sell half there, set the stop for the remainder at break-even, and target the 2nd BB for profit.<br /><br />I would love to find out from the guys if they backtest and if so, how.   <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
