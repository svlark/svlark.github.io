We finally got around to planting a garden this year. We have been planning one since we moved to this house (6 years ago). We planted raspberries, onions, carrots, broccoli, lettuce, squash and bell peppers. &nbsp;The very first week the chipmunks ate most everything above ground. I was given advice to wait until the freeze to harvest our onions and carrots. I sort of spaced about that until yesterday. When I finally dug it all up this was it.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mteX3PGegJs/UIioByrtK3I/AAAAAAAAZog/YHtlfsuQLGE/s1600/IMG_3458.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mteX3PGegJs/UIioByrtK3I/AAAAAAAAZog/YHtlfsuQLGE/s400/IMG_3458.jpeg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">that's our one carrot on the right</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Audrey ate the mini carrot and liked it. I tried to make a yummy vegetable curry with the onions, but unfortunately I screwed something up and it was&nbsp;inedible. I definitely DO NOT have a green thumb!
