Yes, I ordered fish tacos for dinner. &nbsp;They were ok. &nbsp;Not delicious, but do-able. &nbsp;And that was my concrete step for today. &nbsp;Gotta learn to like fish... <br /><br />We're in Steamboat Springs this weekend hanging out with our friend Paul from Chicago. &nbsp;Thus, the <i>tiny</i>&nbsp;steps. &nbsp;But progress is progress.<br /><br />I also put a used copy of Lin and Larry Pardey's <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Cost_Conscious_Cruiser.html?id=Aiy97sjxZWcC">The Cost Conscious Cruiser</a>&nbsp;priced at $2.50&nbsp;in my cart on Amazon. &nbsp;I'm saving up to actually buy it. &nbsp;I'm cost conscious like that.
