The great thing about writing more often is that I have less to report each time. &nbsp;We've been hanging out in Breck the last couple days, so I've only been able to snatch brief moments to push on the goal. &nbsp;I studied forex a little today and also did some boat research. Come to think of it though, our several hours at the pool with the girls today definitely counts as progress too. &nbsp;They're both getting to be really brave in the water. &nbsp;Lorelei is actually a little too brave. &nbsp;She'll just jump into water over her head whether you're there to help her or not. &nbsp;Kinda freaks me out.
