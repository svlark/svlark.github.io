Lo caught 2 catfish from the boat today. &nbsp;I was able to get the hook out of the first one's mouth which was a big first for me. The second ended up snapping the line before we could land him. &nbsp;I guess we need some heavier line on her rod. &nbsp;I'd love to figure out how to bait the hook with something that won't draw catfish though it kinda seems like they'll just bite anything they see.
