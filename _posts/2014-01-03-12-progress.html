I made a couple resolutions on the blog last year, and we've succeeded in a big one:&nbsp; We are debt free.&nbsp; That's an important step in our journey.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've been reading <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wcaR-diN5osC">The Essentials of Living Aboard a Boat</a>, and April and I have been enjoying <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fgtXO9LyROoC">Sell Up and Sail</a>.<br /><br />I've gotten a couple bids for shipping some of our stuff out on uship.
