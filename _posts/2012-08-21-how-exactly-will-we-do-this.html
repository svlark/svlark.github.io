Let's review the situation: &nbsp;We have decent earning capacity, but virtually no savings. &nbsp;I mean we have a non-negligible amount in 401ks but nothing liquid. &nbsp;We have a slightly neglected house in a gorgeous location. &nbsp;We have probably zero equity in this housing market. &nbsp;I don't think we're underwater, but we might be. &nbsp; &nbsp;On the other hand, 2 of our neighbors sold this summer for reasonable money. &nbsp;So who knows. We could break even after paying off the realtor. &nbsp;Hopefully. &nbsp;OK, great. &nbsp;Then what?<br /><br />I think the sequence of events is this, roughly:<br /><br /><ol><li>Between now and next spring, liquidate a lot of junk and put in a lot of sweat-equity (but not money) on aesthetic repairs.</li><li>List and sell, May through August. &nbsp;Try for a profit, but be prepared to just break even.</li><li>Move to month-to-month lease locally.</li><li>Choose somewhere with lots of boats and jobs to job hunt. &nbsp;Probably Miami, since it also provides easy jumping off to island hopping.</li><li>Get a job there.</li><li>Move to a month to month there.</li><li>Boat-hunting. &nbsp;Slowly and patiently.</li><li>Choose and buy boat.</li><li>Move aboard, pay it off, fix it up, learn maintenance and repair of marine diesel, electrical and electronic systems, hulls and decks, sails, rigging, etc..</li><li>Save a cruising kitty.</li><li>Quit, and head for the Bahamas and Caribbean.</li><li>Work out the kinks for 6-12 months.</li><li>Panama</li><li>Passage-making</li><li>Sustain on ~20K/year by eating a lot of fish, stopping to work in boatyards and on 3-6 month programming contracts, doing charters, maybe selling some photos and articles, and hopefully some deliveries. &nbsp;</li></ol><div>So that's the "plan" for now. &nbsp;Let's see how it goes.<br /><br />I found some cool pages on the theory and physics of sailing:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.sailtheory.com/index.html">sailtheory.com</a></li><li><a href="http://web.mit.edu/2.972/www/reports/sail_boat/sail_boat.html">MIT - how a sailboat sails into the wind</a></li><li><a href="http://www.physics.unsw.edu.au/~jw/sailing.html">UNSW - physics of sailing</a></li></ul><br /><br />I want to start to get really specific with boat knowledge. &nbsp;J measurements, cringle radii, clew vangs,&nbsp;fliberty-gibbet ratios, the whole bit. So I'm going to work on that.<br /><br /><br /></div>
