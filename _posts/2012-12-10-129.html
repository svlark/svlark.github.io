We've been doing some planning and boat research in spare moments. <br /><br />As you know, I'm pretty well certain that Americans (among others) have lost their way, however we've decided that we really wanted to stick to happy thoughts on Windward Reach, so I've started another blog as an outlet for crying in the wilderness. &nbsp;When I complete the raison d'Ãªtre essay for that one I'll post a link. &nbsp;I know you're all waiting on tenterhooks.<br /><br />The darn scale kept producing different reading today so who knows? &nbsp;I'm definitely up a bit though.
