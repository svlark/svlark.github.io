I'm starstruck.  I got a note from Pat of <a href="http://www.bumfuzzle.com/">Bumfuzzle</a> and Live on the Margin fame.  He had some kind words of encouragement for us so that was nice.  <br /><br />I got in a good hour of reading his book on the bus today.  I finished the chapter on swing trading and began the chapter on trading fades.<br /><br />We also read another great chapter of South from Alaska. <br /><br />April got a quote from a handyman for helping out with some of our more involved projects to fix up the house and I was actually pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />-27.5 @ 243.6
