Well, it's been a busy weekend. &nbsp;We read the chapters from <u>The Capable Cruiser</u>&nbsp;on the Pardeys' experience outfitting their second boat and on sail care. &nbsp;I definitely need to sit down with the book soon and make some notes. <br /><br />Dad sorted out for me a number of the questions I'd noted earlier on mast-bend, running backstays, clubbed staysails, and the like. &nbsp;Another sets of things to make notes on before I forget...<br /><br />We sold a buffet that we inherited for, wait for it... $450. &nbsp;And I don't even have to deliver it. &nbsp;Woo-hoo.<br /><br />I spent a couple hours compiling stats on various models of boats I've heard great things about to start to develop a sense for the significance of various measurements. &nbsp;I need to finish that up and post it.<br /><br />I have also completed the first two chapters in <u>World Cruising Essentials</u> on boat length and rigs and am halfway through the chapter on engines. &nbsp;Next chapter is on gear -- autopilots, windvanes, etc. <br /><br />I did some investigation into selling a bunch of our books online. &nbsp;For most items, there's no way to beat the existing low price on Amazon and you still have to pay them to store the item while it sits around unpurchased. &nbsp;I think the thing is to pick, say, 10 books of recent fiction and sell them as a lot on ebay for 25 bucks or something. <br /><br />To cap it all off, we watched <u>Captain Ron</u> tonight. &nbsp;Oh, I know it's no undying classic, but I really love that movie. <br /><br />So, a pretty strong weekend for the boat project all around...
