I got one half of the kitchen cabinets all oiled.  The parched wood sucks up the oil and looks a lot better after.  It's probably hard to really see the effects in this picture but for what it's worth...<br /><br />Audrey did a great job with lessons 35 and 36 this evening.  She was really excited to get 3 new primers from GranMiri and immediately dove into sounding out the stories.  Thanks GM!<br /><br />-21.2 @ 250.0 <br/><br/><div class="separator"style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4J47hX3wn4w/UM6xn8PT2UI/AAAAAAAAEII/sNnLN0FsCyE/s640/blogger-image-539251960.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4J47hX3wn4w/UM6xn8PT2UI/AAAAAAAAEII/sNnLN0FsCyE/s640/blogger-image-539251960.jpg" /></a></div>
