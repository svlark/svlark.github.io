I'm really struggling with what to say to the blog lately.&nbsp; The purpose of this exercise for me is to be accountable for taking concrete steps toward our goal each day.&nbsp; I realize that at this point I am primarily reporting on the day-to-day experiences of selling a house and teaching my kids.&nbsp; These are&nbsp; steps we are taking in support of of our goal, but they don't really seem to constitute concrete progress toward getting a boat and casting off.&nbsp; I intend to renew focus on those concrete steps, in addition to forging ahead on reducing our burn rate and educating our kids.&nbsp; Stay tuned for lots of exciting stuff.<br /><br />
