So yeah, as April mentioned, we actually got a call on our Zillow MMM listing. &nbsp;That has seriously kicked me into high gear on getting this house sale-ready. &nbsp;Agile geek that I am, I put up a kanban to organize the effort. &nbsp;For the past couple nights, since we got this call I've been pulling near-all-nighters getting things ship shape. &nbsp;Obviously I can't do all the repairs we had planned before a showing for this weekend, but I think we will have seriously cut the amount of junk and mess around here. &nbsp;Stoked!
