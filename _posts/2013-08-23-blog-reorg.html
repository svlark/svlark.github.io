I've made some tweaks to the blog.&nbsp; There are 2 new tabs: <a href="http://www.svlark.com/search/label/homeschool-journal">Homeschooling</a> and <a href="http://www.svlark.com/search/label/progress-reports">Progress</a>.&nbsp; All due to popular demand, you understand.&nbsp; The main Posts tab, served at the base URL, will henceforth be reserved for posts containing relatively "interesting" content actually intended for consumption by casual readers.&nbsp; My daily reports on homeschooling and on steps toward our goal will show up on the new tabs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for reading!
