<br />We've got all sorts of learning materials coming.&nbsp; Our core will be reading, writing, and math based on <a href="http://www.welltrainedmind.com/">The Well-Trained Mind</a>.&nbsp; For reading, we have lots of graded readers and Audrey has been making fast progress. For writing, we'll have <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2409617.The_Complete_Writer">The Complete Writer: Writing with Ease</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TWtZLoR9Q10C&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=First%20Language%20Lessons%20for%20the%20Well-Trained%20Mind%3A%20Level%201&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q=First%20Language%20Lessons%20for%20the%20Well-Trained%20Mind:%20Level%201&amp;f=false">First Language Lessons</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />More too, but bedtime now.
