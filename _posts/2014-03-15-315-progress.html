We had a visit from the estate sellers today.&nbsp; I'm not sure if that's going to work out.&nbsp; These guys didn't seem to think it was worth their time.<br /><br />On the positive side, April sorted things out with the leasing office and we are in fact done in June.<br /><br />We had a really great day of ownschooling today.<br /><br />95 days.
