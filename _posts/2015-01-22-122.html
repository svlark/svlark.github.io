The outboard is resting securely on the stern rail. &nbsp;There are several very handy items aboard Lark from previous owners. &nbsp;One is the swing arm on the wind turbine mount that allows hoisting and lowering things over the stern with a block and tackle rig. &nbsp;Another is a sweet little threefold purchase block and tackle rig with a jam cleat. &nbsp;Hooking up that rig to the swing arm and the oatboard made hoisting, swinging it overboard, and positioning it on the rail a breeze. &nbsp;Thanks POs!
