We're getting kind of excited about homeschooling.&nbsp; My research on the Robinson and A-2 curricula led me to <span class="product-title"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393067084/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER">The Well-Trained Mind: A Guide to Classical Education at Home</a></span>.&nbsp; There's something incredibly appealing to me about starting out with the trivium -- writing daily, reading great literature and approaching math from addition and multiplication tables.&nbsp; It just makes sense to me.&nbsp; And I love the way that the classical education builds from the trivium into history, logic, rhetoric, Latin, and sciences.&nbsp; I wish I'd had access to logic and rhetoric in school! <br /><br />But how in the world does this fit in with unschooling?&nbsp; I'm not sure but it seems to me that being well-read, articulate, and well-rounded provides the child an awesome toolset to power their interest- and joy-led exploration.&nbsp; Obviously it would be counter-productive to drag a child through material that makes them miserable, and I think unschoolers make great points about that.&nbsp;<br /><br />So anyway, I don't know, I'm thinking 3 or 4 hours a day of classical education with lots of time and support for interest-led stuff.&nbsp; Put all that on boat sailing slowly around the world and I think we've got something incredible in the making.<br /><br />228
