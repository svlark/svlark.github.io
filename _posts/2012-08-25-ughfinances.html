<span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Life is feeling hard right now. I'm so glad to have something to look forward too, like this adventure. Right now it is just about being patient and continuing to work toward the goal. Money is extremely tight! My car needs $4000 worth of work, that we can't afford, so we are using one car, and we are looking at possibly taking a month or two off of preschool, and skipping ski season. It is breaking my heart...both are things I think are important for Audrey, things she loves, and I don't want to take them from her! I applied for a job last night, and finally mailed my licensure paperwork, hopefully those things will happen quickly and get us back on track financially.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I'm going to try and think positive thoughts!</span>
