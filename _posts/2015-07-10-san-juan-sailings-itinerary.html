I'm so excited! I'm going to take a sailing course out of Bellingham, Washington in the end of August. The course covers three ASA (American Sailing Association) certificates. Not only do I plan on learning a lot, but I can't wait to explore the San Juans!<br /><br />Check out the schedule for the class!<br /><br />Day 1 - Sucia Island. A brisk sail across Bellingham Bay to Lummi Island, up scenic Hale Passage, to the most popular of the marine parks.<br />Day 2 - Stuart Island. Cruise through Dahl's Porpoise territory southwest along Orcas Island to Prevost or Reid Harbors. Both are part of a state park. There is a very nice walk (about an hour each way) from both anchorages to Lover's Leap and the Turn Point Lighthouse.<br />Day 3 - Roche Harbor. Visit this historic (circa 1880s) resort and marina on San Juan Island to do some docking practice and wander the gardens while enjoying an ice cream cone.<br />Day 4 - Friday Harbor. Sail around San Juan Island to Friday Harbor, the largest village in the San Juan Islands. Explore this bustling town and enjoy dinner out.<br />Day 5 â€“ Rosario Resort. Cruise past Shaw and into the center of the islands to this stately resort in East Sound (Orcas Island). Tour the historic mansion, enjoy a swim or hot tub, or hike up to Cascade Lake in Moran State Park.<br />Day 6 - Inati Bay. Sail east through Obstruction Pass, drop anchor here on Lummi Island.<br />Day 7 - Bellingham. A morning sail across Bellingham Bay completes your circuit, though truthfully you have tasted but a tiny sample of the delights of the San Juans.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vv4qx8Wrs7Y/VaCQxkuO49I/AAAAAAAAerw/G05_xo-0bqE/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-07-10%2Bat%2B11.37.31%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="434" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vv4qx8Wrs7Y/VaCQxkuO49I/AAAAAAAAerw/G05_xo-0bqE/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-07-10%2Bat%2B11.37.31%2BPM.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />
