Well, we had another big packing day, and no school.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Len and Audrey picked up the U-haul but we didn't really do anything with it. &nbsp;It will be good to be able to get started loading it first thing in the morning. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Len told me a funny story about how Audrey took off her socks and shoes and put them in the glove box. &nbsp;It was her first time riding in the front seat (since it only has a front seat). &nbsp;He said, "I see you put your socks and shoes in the glove box," and she said , "Is that what they call that? I thought it was for socks and shoes."</span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div><font face="Helvetica Neue Light, HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif">We had a really nice last visit to the Backdoor Theatre, and Kayla made a nice little spectacle of us. &nbsp;That was nice.</font></div><div><font face="Helvetica Neue Light, HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">This Nederland weather is not doing anything to put me in a nostalgic mood. &nbsp;With this crazy cold and howling wind, it's really more like it's saying, "... and don't let the door hit you in the ass." &nbsp;Thank you, wind, we won't.&nbsp;</span></div></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bwD6483BQWY/UmIVqiahXlI/AAAAAAAAawQ/DQMDoTJ5kso/s640/blogger-image--321023785.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bwD6483BQWY/UmIVqiahXlI/AAAAAAAAawQ/DQMDoTJ5kso/s640/blogger-image--321023785.jpg"></a></div>
