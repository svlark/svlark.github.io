Len got us a new exterior door to replace the old one on our mud room, so we worked on prepping and painting it today. <br /><br />One thing I forgot to mention that I did the other day was to apply some Pledge orange oil to some of the kitchen cabinets. &nbsp;It actually makes a big difference to that parched wood.
