YWe had a boat management practicum day today. &nbsp;We re-covered all the equipment we had uncovered for yesterday's voyage: helm, winches, windlass, mainsail, and compass. &nbsp;We adjusted all the docklines. &nbsp;We fished for about 10 minutes.<div><br></div><div>Later, Granmiri and Papa took the the girls up the road to the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute where they got to look at a number of exhibits on sealife, including a great touch tank. &nbsp;Thanks guys!</div>
