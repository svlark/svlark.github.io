Whoa. &nbsp;Almost fell off the blog-wagon for a second there. &nbsp;But we're still forging ahead on the plan. <br /><br />We're teaching the girls boat terminology by referring to the bow and stern of the car, the helm, and the cockpit. &nbsp;Around the house, we're referring to the heads, ports, galley, cabins and berths, the dinette, the settee, and the salon. &nbsp;Great suggestion from Mom.<br /><br />We read the insurance chapter in The Capable Cruiser last night. &nbsp;Lin and Larry say that they don't carry health insurance for cruising away from the US. &nbsp;They say healthcare is just affordable elsewhere. &nbsp;Which gave me an awesome idea which I can't tell you about.<br /><br />They also said that while insurance for vessels on passage is very expensive, insurance is pretty affordable for boats cruising coastal waters (where all the rocks and anchor-dragging and other boats are). &nbsp;So I said we should just get insurance any time we arrive somewhere we plan to spend some time, and then like three sentences later they suggested the same thing. &nbsp;We're like totally sympatico.<br /><br />We've also been working on identifying specific, actionable items for our big to-do list. &nbsp;We'd stalled out on that for a bit. &nbsp;It's actually kind of a challenge to get from something like "save up for a boat" to specific things we can start doing to start to achieve that end. &nbsp;One thing we've got going for is that we actually have an excellent budgeting system, for the first time ever, and have been actually living on our budget for a year or so. &nbsp;But anyway, we've been working really hard on getting down to those do-able items, and are making some headway.<br /><br />April sent in all her licensure paperwork so soon she should be able to counsel insurance clients. &nbsp;So we're just waiting for the dollars to start pouring in now. <br /><br />I've been having a hankering to watch Captain Ron for the last couple days. &nbsp;What are some other good sailing movies? &nbsp;Anyone? &nbsp;What about some great sailing books for kids?<br /><br /><br />
