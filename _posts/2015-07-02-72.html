We had a nice brainstorming session on how each of us can make some money on an ongoing basis when we're out cruising. &nbsp;We don't need much but it'll be good to be able to make a bit as needed. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I'm feeling some urgency to get out there for real. &nbsp;It's been a reasonable amount of time to be living in a marina and getting used to the experience of being aboard but it's time to get going now. &nbsp;The whole point is to have more of time to myself to spend with my family and see the world. &nbsp;To do that I must rouse myself from the comfortable rut I'm in. &nbsp;Again.</div>
