Audrey and I watched <u>Shipwrecked</u> this evening. &nbsp;Exciting stuff! &nbsp;It's about a Norwegian boy whose father is injured and in order to earn the money to head off a foreclosure on the family farm he ships out to sea. &nbsp;We also did a little TYCTR, but she was pretty tired and silly so we didn't do too much.<br /><br />I cleaned up the To-do page. &nbsp;It was pretty chaotic before, I thought. &nbsp;Not that there's any less to do now, but I'm keeping it at a higher level on that page now.<br /><br />I've also spent some time on boat research this evening.<br /><br />-19.1 @ 252.1
