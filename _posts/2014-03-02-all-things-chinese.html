Audrey really likes to tell people how 'I really like all things Chineseâ€¦I'm going to do a play about it at school, I read Chinese library books, I have Chinese pajamas (actually brought from China by her great-grandma Verna!), a Chinese teddy bear (a panda) and I even like the color red!'<br /><div><br /></div><div>She is certainly enamored with China right now! KinderHeart, her homeschooling supplemental program, is working on a performance about the Monkey King, an ancient Chinese fairytale, and it has really sparked her interest. We have been attempting to capitalizing on her interest by incorporating China into our current lessons. Fortunately, China is an ancient culture, so it fit very nicely into our plans for reading and history!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7lUJPE6vNTU/UxQCAMwLThI/AAAAAAAAbQA/_rm42qGqNOo/s1600/IMG_5128.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7lUJPE6vNTU/UxQCAMwLThI/AAAAAAAAbQA/_rm42qGqNOo/s1600/IMG_5128.jpg" height="640" width="464" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Audrey's painting of Fruit Tree Mountain from The Monkey King</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></div>
