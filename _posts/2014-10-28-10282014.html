We're 2 weeks in to living aboard. &nbsp;Some things have gone better and others worse than expected. <br /><br />The small space and large crowd haven't been a big deal in terms of friction between personalities. &nbsp;Parenting is difficult just as it was ashore. <br /><br />April has been struggling with the rather severe limitations of our galley. &nbsp;It didn't help that the refrigeration died over the weekend due to a coolant leak, leading to the loss of no small amount of groceries.<br /><br />Sweet Pea has had the most significant struggles adapting to life aboard but even she is adjusting: she goes down the companionway without assistance; and I believe would go up likewise with the addition of some fiddles on the backs of the steps. &nbsp;She has been boarding and landing on her own depending on the tides. &nbsp;At high tide she takes some convincing. <br /><br />Internet access for my job has turned out to be a piece of cake, no thanks to the marina's wifi offering, but thanks entirely to the wired service in their lounge.<br /><br />Maintenance and repairs have provided no shortage of growth opportunities.<br /><br />Feeling at home has come very easily for us. &nbsp;Sailing our home has been a joy. &nbsp;The neighbors have been generous, encouraging, and inspiring.<br /><br />Our instructor, Cap'n Jack, has brought us a couple thrilling ideas for learning experiences: &nbsp;One is for him to accompany us on a day trip up the River to Vero Beach and then return on our own. &nbsp;The other is for me to accompany him on a delivery job from Jacksonville to Ft. Pierce next week if it comes through. <br /><br />We are excited to see what happens next! <br /><br /><br />
