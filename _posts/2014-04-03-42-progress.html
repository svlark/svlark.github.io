We made our best progress in weeks. I set us up on <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">wunderlist</a> and it's been huge for me just to be able to brain-dump everything into that .&nbsp; I'd been looking for a long time for a simple todo list manager that April and I could use to share tasks and with a mobile app but without a lot GTD baggage and this one finally fit the bill.<br /><br />Anyway, we got in some good progress on working through our photographic inventory of all our stuff identifying what we're keeping.&nbsp; At this point, that's the strategy -- identify what we're keeping, and set a date when we start moving the rest down to the&nbsp; "take a chair, leave a table" area down by the dumpsters.<br /><br />72 days.
