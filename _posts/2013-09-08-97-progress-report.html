I'm really enjoying the Goodlander book, and it's making me think about boat-buying a little differently.&nbsp; I'm not sure just how completely we'll end up embracing the approach of buying a boat with a major problem and a ticking clock, but certainly the ticking clock sounds good.&nbsp; I have yet to read Cap'n Fatty's master plan for rehabbing a boat, but hopefully it won't involve years of work.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; He's certainly an engaging writer, one way or the other.<br /><br />We're trying to make ourselves get serious about moving out but it's kinda hard...
