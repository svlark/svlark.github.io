It's going to be so cool some night to be standing watch in the tropics and watching the bioluminescence in the wake.&nbsp; Maybe one of my girls will be sitting in the cockpit with me, while everyone else is asleep.&nbsp; It'll be a nice breezy night, not too windy, and we'll be sitting quietly watching for fishing boats.&nbsp; We'll have just recently gotten into Mexican waters, and I'll notice it out of the corner my eye.&nbsp; We'll spend the next hour staring at it, entranced.&nbsp; It'll be great.
