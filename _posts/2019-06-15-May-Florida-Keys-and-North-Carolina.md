May, 2019 - Florida Keys - North Carolina

We had a list of long-overdue boat stuff to take care when we arrived back in the US.  A big one was that the life raft that came with the boat was far overdue for service, and when they inflated it, it fell apart. We spent the big bucks to replace the eight-person offshore life raft... that I hope to never see the inside of. 

![Loey with the life raft](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/61883556-ac5d5200-aec8-11e9-9fc1-b0df6981e72c.jpeg)
Lorelei helped me pick up the new raft in Ft. Lauderdale. This one is identicle to our new one, only smaller. 

We visited the Turtle Hospital in Marathon, and the girls are really gung-ho about raising some money for the patients.

After visiting the turtle hospital, the girls decided to raise some money for them with a lemonade stand at the marina. We also adopted a turtle, so they are really looking forward to the mail with updates on their new charge.

I mostly post pictures of the exciting stuff, but here some of our daily grind hanging at the pool and getting our school work done.

We were waved off the dock in Marathon by this beautiful Eagle Ray. 

We are starting to get the hang of this passage making stuff.  It was five days up to Beaufort, North Carolina.

Audrey has really been a helpful member of the crew lately. She has taken over about half of the meal prep on passage.

The girls were excited to spot land after 5 days at sea. 

Beaufort is such a cute town, with lots to do! I think weâ€™ll stay awhile.

The girls' favorite land spot in Beaufort. This old oak tree is a fun place to climb, play, dangle, and read.

Getting a good look at the wild horses on Carrot Island from our dinghy. These horses are not the same Spanish herd that went down on the Shackleford Banks. These guys belonged to a farmer from Beaufort that would pasture them here in the early 1900s. When he died the town decided to leave them there, because they were thriving.
