I'm starting to work out how to work in Mountain Time and live on the East Coast.&nbsp; Basically, I still live Mountain Time.&nbsp; I work from 10 to 7 and take lunch at 2.&nbsp; 10 feels like 8; 2 feels like noon; 7 feels like 5.&nbsp; Instead of sleeping from 10ish to 6ish, now I sleep from 12ish to 8ish.&nbsp; The girls have shifted their sleeping and waking similarly.&nbsp; Well, that was easy!<br /><br />We'll attempt to launch Lark two Saturdays from now.&nbsp; Like all proper boat owners, we have a long and growing list of things we need to do, ought to do and wish we could do.&nbsp; That's how we know we're proper.
