I tool down the jib in preparation to have it picked up by Mack Sails to have the sun panel restitched. &nbsp;Tomorrow I'll take down the main so they can take it and repair a tear in a batten pocket. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I laid down some rough-cut plywood peices on the cockpit floor to distribute loads across a wider area. &nbsp;We are bracing for a big project. &nbsp;Once we get both sails folded and off to Mack, I will start tapping and getting a sense of how big. &nbsp;Then we'll need to decide about recoring or just building up the top skin. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
