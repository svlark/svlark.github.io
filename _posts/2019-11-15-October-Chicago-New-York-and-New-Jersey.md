before and after

After 16 months in Braces, Audrey had them taken off! Yay! She will be using Invisalign about half the time now for the unforeseeable future. She is really happy with the results, but funnily enough, she was really liking the look of braces, and misses them too.

As soon as we got back to New York, GranMiri and Papa joined us on Lark for a visit. We even were able to have a fun day with Aunt Amy!

Bonus! We were even able to hang out with Traveler! 


Our original plan was to skip straight from NYC to Puerto Ricoâ€¦ but boat plans are written in sand and a broken auto pilot had us pull into Cape May, New Jersey instead.
