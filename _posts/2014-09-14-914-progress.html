We took the weekend off from constant boat work, but April had her first boat-handling lesson on Lark Saturday (I had mine on Tuesday).&nbsp; It went well and Captain Ron would have applauded her docking skillz.&nbsp; Sweet Pea also had her first visit to Lark this evening.&nbsp; She did not much care for boarding nor for the companionway.&nbsp; We'll have to work something out for her.<br><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PnHAdXZFCYU/VBZVMgxv9KI/AAAAAAAAcmw/p3oL6TsYDgg/s640/blogger-image--962211881.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PnHAdXZFCYU/VBZVMgxv9KI/AAAAAAAAcmw/p3oL6TsYDgg/s640/blogger-image--962211881.jpg"></a></div>
