I made some good headway on fixing a leaky faucet and repairing our old window frames and sills. &nbsp;Exciting stuff.<br /><br />On the homeschooling front, Mom sent sent us several primers that Audrey's been enjoying introducing some vowel and consonant sounds, and mentioned&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MUucJV0dRaIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=teach+your+child+to+read+in+100+lessons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jtCgaF9503&amp;sig=YY3ohiBtsTQoOgl_cNJNqUA0P6o&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xd1fULVRhpysAbzHgaAE&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=teach%20your%20child%20to%20read%20in%20100%20lessons&amp;f=false">Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons</a>. &nbsp;Looks promising. &nbsp;She also owned up to sending us the Stuart book and learning to sail book last week. &nbsp;Thanks Mom! &nbsp;We're really enjoying them.<br /><br />Tonight we're going to read the milk run chapter in The Capable Cruiser.<br /><br /><br />
