Well, we started to grout the shower.  Then we ran out of grout.  I sure hope there's not some dire consequence to allowing half your grout project to dry before doing the other half.  I mean we didn't let big glops dry on the tile or anything.  I will say that I'd be perfectly happy if this turns out to be the last time I ever have to grout. <br /><br />I also hauled the debris from demoing the old hardboard travesty in the midst of a blizzard.  It snowed for 20 minutes today and I spent the whole time at the dump.  Good times.<br /><br />241.3.  Sigh.
