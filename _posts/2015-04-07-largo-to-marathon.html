Key Largo to Marathon<br /><div><br /><br /></div><div>We left Key Largo at about 7:30a and made it about halfway to Marathon by 12p. &nbsp;Because of our vacuum problems last week we were keeping a close eye on the Racor gauge, which ran right at zero for the first couple hours, at which point we began to feel more comfortable.</div><div><br /></div><div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sJXaPiZG4Pk/VSKcGTbRfSI/AAAAAAAAePE/QTteJ4mQEg4/s640/blogger-image-1079457356.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sJXaPiZG4Pk/VSKcGTbRfSI/AAAAAAAAePE/QTteJ4mQEg4/s640/blogger-image-1079457356.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">leaving at sunrise</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><br /></div><div>Shortly after noon, however, I noticed some fluctuations in rpms without anyone touching the throttle. &nbsp;Something felt off so I checked the vacuum guage on the Racor. &nbsp;It was higher than I've ever seen it. &nbsp;I also saw that the squeeze bulb I'd added when I replaced the fuel lines in Key Largo was collapsed.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">So there was an obstruction somewhere upstream of the squeeze bulb and all the fuel from the Racor at least as far back as the bulb had been sucked out. &nbsp;</span></div><div><br /></div><div>Additionally, for the first time since before the fuel polishing, the Racor bowl was full of sediment and the filter was really dirty.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GJxGq2JpT7o/VSKcDdGyHvI/AAAAAAAAeO8/O-xk_RZZwz0/s640/blogger-image-1794691408.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GJxGq2JpT7o/VSKcDdGyHvI/AAAAAAAAeO8/O-xk_RZZwz0/s640/blogger-image-1794691408.jpg" width="597" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sediment out of the vacuum bowl</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DzPfxhB46bw/VSKcA6ShpSI/AAAAAAAAeO0/gCX0lIE_VB8/s640/blogger-image-1757055849.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DzPfxhB46bw/VSKcA6ShpSI/AAAAAAAAeO0/gCX0lIE_VB8/s640/blogger-image-1757055849.jpg" width="622" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a very dirty filter</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>We threw the anchor in and called Towboat and they sent a boat to tow us the last 25 miles to Marathon. &nbsp;It really was a marathon tow. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Just to keep things interesting, April spotted something a couple feet below the surface and about 25 feet back which seemed to be following or chasing us and exactly matching our speed. &nbsp;We both stared at it for while until I finally realized what we were seeing. &nbsp;It was crab pot we must've run over at some point. &nbsp;We radioed the tow boat captain. He slowed and circled and after a couple tries was able to snag the line with a grappling hook. He brought it up and I cut it. &nbsp;We were able to make another knot the rest of the way.</div><div><br /></div><div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_aN7towfMLM/VSKb93fqIOI/AAAAAAAAeOs/ZpTgjeMiTXY/s640/blogger-image-39243278.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_aN7towfMLM/VSKb93fqIOI/AAAAAAAAeOs/ZpTgjeMiTXY/s640/blogger-image-39243278.jpg" width="480" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the remains of our crab trap</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>So now here we lie, tied up in a rather expensive marina, 12 hours after departing, &nbsp;8 hours after throwing in the anchor, 5 hours after Towboat picked us up, and completely confused about our fuel system.<br /><br /><br /></div>
