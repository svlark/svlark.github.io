We had a great plotting session this evening.&nbsp;<br /><br />We nailed down our packing strategy: 15 boxes.&nbsp; We were honestly hoping for a bit less, but we'll get there.<br /><br />Next steps on the Tanton are insurance, slip rent, and NADA valuation.&nbsp; Are we really trying to buy it?&nbsp; Dunno.&nbsp; We really like it, and this is a worthwhile exercise to learn how this process works.&nbsp; If it all falls into place, I think it could be a great boat for us.<br /><br />It's time to get serious about the work situation.&nbsp; So yeah, that's up next.
