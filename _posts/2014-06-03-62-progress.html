Well, we're starting to be really excited and anxious all at once.<br /><br />I'm going to observe the survey on Friday, and in the meantime we're getting the willies about the short term rental we'd been planning on.&nbsp; The landlady would like a deposit, which seems reasonable, but we're not going to just send some random person a check.&nbsp; Hopefully she'll agree to an escrow.com thing, and if not, I guess we have a scam on our hands, and worse, a housing gap.<br /><br />Anyone know of a good short-term furnished rental in Ft. Pierce? <br /><br />School has been getting downright spotty, but I guess we could always just declare summer vacation, seeing as how everyone else already has.&nbsp; <br /><br />16 days
