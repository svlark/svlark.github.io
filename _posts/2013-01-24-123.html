I got to read about 10 minutes on options today.<br /><br />I got paint color-matched for some interior jobs and got yet another new locking knob to replace the newly-broken on the old door. &nbsp;sigh...<br /><br />It was a big day for realizations, not least of which is that I need more sleep, so it will have to wait for another day sometime soon for me to write about the the significance of taking down our baby gates; how the whole family getting hit with the flu led to the best day I've had in a couple years; and to elaborate on the importance or reducing your nut.<br /><br />And Audrey killed on lesson 55.<br /><br />-28.6 @&nbsp;242.6<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">  </span>
