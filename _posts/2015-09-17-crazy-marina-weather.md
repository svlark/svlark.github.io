We had some kind of crazy microburst or something come through.  I thought it was funny when the girls' schoolbooks slid off the dining table.  When I got up and looked out the light and saw the surface of the water rather the boat in the next slip I thought something must really be going on.  I opened the companionway and saw the boats across the fairway heeled over under bare poles like it was a brisk day of sailing.  

I kinda freaked out when I looked to my right and saw the bow of the Gulfstar that's normally ten feet away 6 inches from our Lark's gunwale.  She'd broken her windward piling clean off!  We got some extra fenders over that gunwale and I boarded the Gulfstar directly from Lark's cockpit.  The skipper on the next boat windward of the Gulfstar dropped one of his spare lines over his leeward piling and heaved it to me and I secured the Gulfstar in its normal position.  I sure hope that piling holds.

Definitely makes you think twice about weathering a tropical system in a marina...
