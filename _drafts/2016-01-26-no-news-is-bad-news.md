We made no concrete headway on this diesel situation today. We're still waiting to hear back from the welder. I imagine he'll probably have quite a backlog when he does get back.

I did make a number of calls trying to locate replacement hoses and studs, and will be grabbing an Ã¼ber early in the morning pick those up.

I threw a coat of high temp Rustoleum on the heat exchanger in spots where I will hopefully never again have access once this job is all said and done.

We are dying to be out of this darn marina and back out on the hook where we belong.
