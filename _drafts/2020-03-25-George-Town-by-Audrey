 One of my favorite things in Georgetown is all the kids. We get to see all our friends almost every single day! One of the hardest trials of boating life for me personally, is sometimes being in a place where there aren’t any kids. 
This place reminds me of guatemala a lot. Like Guatemala, it is like a friend paradise!  At top season with over three hundred and eighty boats here we get to see lots of friends every day! The other reason Georgetown reminds me of Guatemala is because of the network of trails running through the island, leading to places like The Monument, a giant pillar of stone looming over the entire harbor, and Hole Three, a lagoon buried in the heart of the island. One of my favorite things to do in Georgetown is explore the twists and turns of the island’s beautiful trails. Guatemala also had trails running through it’s jungle, they led to places like Torrel Del Shaman and The Natural Pools. 
   Unlike Guatemala we can jump into the crystal blue waters and not worry about getting eaten by crocodiles, and so far we haven’t had any problems with the sharks! A big difference from Guatemala is the prices. In Guatemala everything was very affordable! Not like here where everything is super expensive! It’s $25 for a package of paper towels!
   The Regatta is also a lot of fun, my mom my sister and I entered the Tshirt design contest. You design a picture to go on the regatta Tshirt for next year. People vote for their favorite. None of us won but I know a lot of people who voted for mine! Me and my sister entered the variety show, we put on a magic show! Lorelei pulled lights from me and her own cloak. For the grand finale, I gave her a paper bag and she packed her lights away back into it.
Me and my friends also help Mr. Bill with his operetta. We stood behind him and marched. 
My favorite adult performance was Mr. Ian’s, He called it musical impressions, dressing up as famous singers and singing like them! 
    Me and my friend Heather entered the kayak race on small boat day. It was a lot of fun, but we didn’t even get close to winning, we were second to last! My mom and her friend Mr. Eric entered the blind dinghy race, that’s when one person wears a blind fold and rows while the other person tells them where to go. My mom told Mr. Eric where to go, but unfortunately the oar broke, and they didn’t win either. The other event in the small boat races was the paddle board race. My friends Aiden and Jordan both competed. Jordan won fourth!
   There were two events in family day: the sand sculpture competition, and the small boat races. A week before the competition me and Heather made our boat. She was a  trimeran, her middle hull was made out of a coconut husk, and her two outer hulls were made out of strips of pool noodle. We made a square sail out of and old reusable grocery bag and used rocks as ballasts, and named her the S.V. Dolphin. during the race she capsised so she didn’t even cross the finish line, but we did win first prize for the most ecological boat. My sister’s boat, S.V. The Singray’s Thorn, on the other hand was first across the finish line! for the sand sculpture competition, Heather, Alexa, and I teamed up and made an awesome sand mural with a mommy turtle, a baby turtle, and a mermaid. Our friends Luke and Katie tied with us for third place, while Lorelei’s team, which included Aiden and Luke’s little sister Charlotte won first. Afterwards to end the festivities there was a bonfire with all you can eat smores.
   We also celebrated my birthday here, we had a big bonfire on flipflop, Mom set up a scavenger hunt and relay race! Afterward I had Alexa, Mia, and Heather over for a sleepover (We got approximately 3 hours of sleep! Mabey we should call it a nonsleep-over!), we played Coup, which is an interesting game I got for my birthday, and watched a movie.
