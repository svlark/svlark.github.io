checking in with customs and the Old Bahama Bay marina. A notoriously expensive marina. knowing that we would probably be there a week I asked if they would give us a weekly rate, and she cut me a deal. Instead of $2 a foot with 25 a day for electric plus metered water, she charged us $1.50 a foot and waived the water and power fee. I guess it never hurts to ask! 



Our first morning at the marina a local fisherman came by and offered to sell me some fresh lobster tails. I bought 4 for $20…which my dad thinks was a little steep. I probably need to work on my bargaining skills!



We went to town one afternoon and had lunch and a stop at the local grocery and post office. It is such a different experience than going anywhere in the states. West End is an incredibly small town and the grocery was about the size of our garage in Nederland. Fresh produce was in VERY short supply. I think I was expecting to see at least lots of tropical fruit, but there wasn’t. I did buy a head of broccoli, and it was $5 for one. That night I was very insistent that everyone eat all of their greens! Not only are they pricey, but they are rare!



We had a nice visit from our Ft. Pierce friends who are living over here now too. They are staying at a marina in Freport and rented a car to drive around the island of Grand Bahama for the day and visited us! It was so fun to see them!
