We started April with some pretty routine marina life: enjoying the free, easy laundry; using the marina bikes; the marina lounge with its free air conditioning and great wifi; and meeting new friends. 

We had a wonderful, if WAY TOO brief, visit from some old friends. The Take Two Crew stopped by for dinner as they were passing through our neighborhood, on the way back to their boat in the Florida Keys. We haven’t seen them since our hurricane season together in Rio Dulce, Guatemala three years ago. Before that, they were our first kid boat friends! They were living aboard their Catamaran with their 5 kids in Ft. Pierce, Florida when we bought Lark the 1st. They were mentors to us when everything from boat life to homeschooling was brand new. I miss them already…I can’t wait for our paths to cross again. 

Big News! We finally moved Lark from her berth at Brunswick Landing Marina to St. Marys Boat Services. It was only a one day sail, but we really enjoyed ourselves. It was wonderful to be back out on the water again! 

We celebrated our birthdays with a fun lunch and stroll around Fernandina Beach, in North Florida. Then the girls went with me to the Oatland Wildlife Refuge, outside of Savannah,  in hopes that we would finally see an armadillo. I have been on a mission to see one, after not seeing them on Cumberland Island where they are supposed to be plentiful. Unfortunately, I was foiled again. The resident armadillo at the refuge was sleeping deep in his burrow while we were there. We did have a beautiful walk and were able to see some other amazing birds and animals that had been rescued. 

We are enjoying being back in St. Marys even if living in the boatyard is NOT my cup of tea…think  port-potty, and lots of no-see-ums. We spent most of the month of January here, and it feels very comfortable and familiar to be back.  While Lark is here, we hope to give her a bottom job, and maybe even a bit of a galley re-fit.
