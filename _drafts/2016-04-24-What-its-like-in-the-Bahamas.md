What it’s like in the Bahamas.  

The biggest things is that the water is brilliant blue in a million different shades and it’s everywhere you look. Navigational aids are unusual. The Sea of  Abaco is a protected cruising ground 2 to 6 miles wide between Abaco and the cays (pronounced “keys”) lying to its east.

Bahamians drive on the left.  Half the cars have the driver sitting on the right.  While the country is officially on the metric system, the speed limits are in mph.  On the cays people mostly drive golf carts. 

There are wild parrots and chickens on Green Turtle Cay.  There are wild pigs on No Name Cay.

Food, water, and fuel are expensive.   The Bahamian dollar is pegged to the US dollar so you give and accept change in mixed US and Bahamas currency.  The food is mostly burgers, chicken and fish.  Peas and rice is actually rice with some kind of bean mixed in.  It’s ok but not great.  

Most places we’ve gone most people are black.  Except Man-O-War Cay.  There, everyone’s white and named Albury.  Hope Town is also about half Alburys and Malones. Cruisers are everywhere.  

Every morning at 8 cruisers all over the the area share information on VHF channel 68.  Abaco is over 100 miles long from north to south and almost all empty pine forest.
