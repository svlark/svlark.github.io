July 2019 - Maine

It was only one overnight from Onset, Massachusetts to Rockland, Maine. It barely felt like a passage at all. We had heard amazing things about Penobscot Bay, so we decided it is where we should start our cruise of the Vacation State. 
 
We started out in Rockland, because of the free anchoring, but just a short hop up the bay is Camden, where they were celebrating 4th of July with fireworks over the mooring field. 

There are so many places to explore, just in this bay alone. We are keeping a faster pace and spending weekends (when we donâ€™t need great cell/internet) to check out the more remote locations. 

Even though school is out for summer for so many, we are attempting to stay on track. We find that sticking to a schedule makes our daily routine more fun. We school year round, but take breaks for sailing, and visiting when ever the situation presents itself. 

Audrey was due for a braces adjustment, and both girls had been dying to take my Aunt and Uncle up on their offer for a visit to Colorado, so they took off as unaccompanied minors first to Colorado, then to Chicago.

While the girls were away, Jacob and I acted like it was our second honeymoon. 

My Dad brought the girls home to us, and we showed him around Mt. Desert and Acadia National Park for a couple of days.
