With the boat safely put up in St. Mary's we decided to have a visit with GranMiri and Papa. We spent a week sleeping in the cabin, exploring waterfalls, visiting train exhibits and enjoying the very pleasant weather in the Georgia mountains.

Everything was blooming in the yard!

A fun outing to Fairy Falls, just outside of Taccoa Falls.

A visit to Chow Ram Waterfall, complete with hiking trails and lots of swimming holes.

We spotted a Bluetailed Skink at Chow Ram

Next stop, the girls and I had a solo roadtrip to Illinois to surprise Grampsy for his birthday while Jacob went to check out a property we'd been eying in Alaska. 

![Solo RT pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/122474245-f81fb580-cf90-11eb-84e6-5b3751de2685.jpg)
Rest stop somewhere between Georgia and Illinois.

Audrey decided she wanted a change and got her first ever significant haircut. She was going for a Jennifer Lawrence in Passengers look.

We went on a Mother's Day Hike at Crabtree Nature Center and spotted this cute little muskrat. 

![Grampsy and Lo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/122474252-fa820f80-cf90-11eb-81e2-cabefb80b137.jpg)
All dressed up for German food.

![Lo's new earings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/122474256-fb1aa600-cf90-11eb-9648-0d82199176dd.jpg)
More big changes, Lorelei got her ear's pierced.

Once again, Grampsy grilled his own birthday feast. I don't think he minded though, it tasted amazing, which is not what would have happened if I tried to man the grill. 

![Chipmunk on the back porch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/122474262-fce46980-cf90-11eb-92b7-121d79057886.jpg)
Lots of fun critter spotting from Grampsy's back deck.

Including many deer...

...and this woodchuck that got himself stuck up a tree. I wonder what chased him up there?

We love getting together with our wonderful homeschool friends in Illinois! 

Jacob joined us in Illinois, and we all started the drive back towards the boat in Georgia. 

![Jacob biking](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13930968/122474269-ffdf5a00-cf90-11eb-91ee-743667c14bb2.jpg)
but first Jacob was able to enjoy a week in Illinois. We love riding in the forest preserve just behind my dad's house!

The Pandolfi's chicken is such a good sport!

It's always sad saying goodbye!

On the way we spotted some cicadas! We thought we might miss brood X, but we were in for a real treat, when we found them in droves in Maryland.

We buttoned up the boat for hurricane season, while the girls stayed with GranMiri and Papa again. Then we all played in Toccoa for another week, before heading north to New Hampshire where we rented a cool townhouse for the month to go to PorcFest, visit friends and hopefully get a feel for the Free State.

Papa assisted the girls in putting together a dollhouse while we were there.

There are so many amazing waterfalls to visit near GranMiri and Papa's house.

We did a ton of Plein Air painting! The weather was perfect for it, and the setting amazing.
