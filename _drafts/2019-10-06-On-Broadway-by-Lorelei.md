In New York we went to two shows. We saw Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on Broadway.

The Set of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child

The play was about Harry Potter’s son, and Malfoy’s son, and Voldemort’s daughter. 

The show was 2 separate plays, and each one was between 2 and 3 hours long. In between we went out for pizza.

Times Square

We had to hold hands the whole time so we didn't get lost! There were so many people.

We took the subway down to Broadway. 

There were really cool effects and my favorites where when they went back in time and swam under water. When they went back in time I felt like they were inside of a bubble.

After the show we posed with our patronus

We also went to see Blue Man Group off Broadway. It was amazing, but if you go, be prepared because you need a strong stomach. The grossest part was when a blue man put marshmallows all the way down his throat and spit it into some poor woman’s purse.

It was sort of educational too, I learned a lot about the dangers of texting and the rods and cones in my eyes. 

My favorite part was the fun dancing, toilet paper and strobe lights! This was my daddy’s 4th time going to the show! He said it has changed a lot since the first time he went, and he still loved it.

All of the toilet paper after the show.

We took our first NYC taxi to Blue Man Group.
