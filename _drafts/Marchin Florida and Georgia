I officially have a bright, beautiful teenager! Unfortunately we were not surrounded with lots of kids this year to invite to a birthday party, but some of Audrey’s grandparents really helped us make it feel special!

Grampsy flew in to celebrate birthday week.

We took Audrey mini-golfing before our annual hibachi feast.

We took Audrey mini-golfing before our annual hibachi feast.

We rented a fun house with a pool and a game room in Orlando for the occasion!

Granmiri and Papa drove down too!

...and Aunt Amy even stopped by with a yummy breakfast.

Having the house meant we didn’t need to go out to find our fun. We did take a great trip to Kelly Park/Rock Springs. They had been closed all winter and we lucked out with them opening again in time for us to visit before heading north again.

Found a great wildlife drive on the way back to Georgia.

The orange groves where gorgeous and in full bloom. I wish I could somehow share the beautiful smell of orange blossoms filling the air here on the blog.

Audrey has decided that she LOVES St. Patrick’s Day, because it is the day she was originally due on, so we really tried to do it up. We made shamrock quesadillas, watched an Irish movie (Legend of Kells), and went out for Irish food and live music at night.

The girls and I decided to take a field trip to Savannah to see the beautiful Forsyth park and do a little Plane Eire art. We also treated ourselves to a tea party.

Back in Brunswick we had manatee stop by the boat. I don’t care how many times you see them, like dolphins or whales… it never gets old.
