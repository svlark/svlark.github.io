August 1-15th
Kid boats- The kids got home just in time for a kid boat party. We met in Northeast Harbor, Maine, part of Acadia National Park with 4 other kid boats! We even got to share a float with our new friends from Anjulia Sue. 

Most of our new friends heading south, but we still wanted to explore further north before fall arrived, so we headed ‘Down East’. 

Going to see Machias Seal Island had been on my ‘must do’ list since we arrived in Maine. It was rumored to have the largest population of sea birds in this area, including PUFFINS! It is also an interesting place in that it is the only disputed territory between the US and Canada. 

After our Puffin pit stop, we decided to cross into Canada and brave the Bay of Fundy. The Bay of Fundy have the largest tides in the world! The crazy tides around here can cause really interesting and sometimes scary water phenomena, like boils, whirlpools and extremely strong currents!
