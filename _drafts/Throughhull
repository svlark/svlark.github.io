So we were all set to just screw the tailpiece onto the through-hull and slide the hose down on the barb and be done with the whole job.  But Lark had other ideas.  She decided to take this opportunity to let us know that the through-hull needing to be resealed, whine the hole thing started turning in place as I was snugging the coupler onto the threads of the through-hull too.  Fun!
