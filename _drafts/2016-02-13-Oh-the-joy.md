Cruising has been a struggle this past month. We've had a run-in with the state, a failed exhaust manifold gasket, been stuck in an expensive marina, and passed on what turned out to have been a beautiful crossing window. At the same time we've spent time with Len, M&D, Madsams, mc mermaids, Kayla and Jay and their girls, and a couple of new cruising friends. I do think it's all been part of an important growing process for us. Each challenge has required us to cope with frustration and fear, and I believe we're stronger, braver, and more capable because of them. But I sure do hope we catch the next window.
