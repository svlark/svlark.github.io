We hiked Cahuita National Park today— 6 miles from Cahuita to Puerto Vargas.  The first 3/4 followed the shore and the last quarter was a boardwalk right through the jungle, or bosque.  This section of the Carribean coast has a famously consistent and powerful shore break, known as the Salsa Brava, which formed a constant background to the day’s adventure. We saw many capuchins and heard many but saw only a few howlers.  We also saw several sloths.  In the last section, through the bosque we saw and heard the most wildlife.  About halfway along the last section of boardwalk, Lorelei was startled by a large spider under the railing right at her eye level.  We stopped to take pictures which we showed to a local later in the evening, who was visibly concerned, telling us that it looked like a Brazilian Wandering Spider.  Shortly afterward we heard an amazing racket— long, loud, and almost musical.  we looked up. way up.  And finally found the source of the noise— a group of green parrots at least 200 feet up in the canopy.  Not to be outdone, the howlers began their haunting chorus, first to our left, then to our right , and then behind us. It’s an incredible sound— simultaneously soulful and hollow.

For our first Saturday in Cost Rica we decided to do a 10 km hike through Cahuita National Park, just north of Puerto Viejo. We got a little bit of a late start, as it was a rainy day, and we kept waiting for the rain to pass. As the big drops slowed we decided to wear rain coats and face the drizzle. The first 7 km of the hike have the gorgeous Caribbean on one side and the jungle on the other, and after rounding the last curve of shoreline the beaches turned volcanic, with dark black/purple sand.  Lorelei managed to smear it all over herself and look like a coal miner. 

The last 3 km took a boardwalk straight through the heart of the jungle. We felt completely surround by the jungle noises of birds, frogs, insects, howler monkeys and who knows what else! 

Along the way we saw a ton of animals too, including monkeys, sloths, parrots, and several types of spiders, one as big as our hand that Lorelei almost grabbed as it was snuggled up under one of the hand railings eating a meal. 

At dinner that night we showed our local waitress the giant spider’s picture and she was convinced it was a Brazilian Wandering Spider, one of the deadliest in the world, known for pouncing on people that it feels threatened by. I guess we are lucky it was preoccupied!
