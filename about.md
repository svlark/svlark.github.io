Hi.  This is us!  Our adventures  have taken us from Deadhorse to Moose Factory, from Caniapiscau to Kodiak, from James Bay to the Puerto Viejo, and from Whitehorse to Spanish Wells, from Fernie to Rio Dulce, from Juneau to Sint Maarten.  Here's our tracker: https://forecast.predictwind.com/tracking/display/LarkOrion.

Jacob grew up sailing with his family in Florida. He is a software engineer and amateur homeschool teacher. April had never sailed herself until we bought Lark. She is a professional mom and homeschool teacher, and a part-time psychotherapist. Our kids are Audrey and Lorelei. Audrey loves swimming, skiing, reading, and any type of crafting.  Lorelei loves animals, swimming and painting.  

There's a great book, Sell up and Sail.  Well, we've sold up and are sailing!  As Bill and Laurel put it, we are ready to, "abandon brick walls and gardens, property taxes, and interference from authorities who continually tried to order what we might or might not do."

"Have we not, some people ask, merely exchanged one set of problems for another?  Yes, in a sense.  We have exchanged the insoluble problems of politics, the fast pace of modern life, the battles with bureaucracy, the appaling proliferation of paper which push one to the edge of madness, for problems of wind and wave and how and where to go next."

We love sailing!  There's nothing like the sensation of losing sight of one shore, spending days on end with just the people we love on this tiny little island we call Lark with nothing but water out to the horizon, and finally going ashore in another place we've never been.  It never gets old.
